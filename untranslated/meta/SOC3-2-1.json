These amputations are typically the result of severe, uncontrolled diabetes leading to conditions such as peripheral artery disease, neuropathy, and infections that do not heal properly.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the prevalence of severe diabetes-related complications within a population. Diabetes is a chronic condition that, when poorly managed, can lead to serious health issues, including the need for limb amputation. Monitoring the number of diabetic-related amputations provides insight into the burden of diabetes on the healthcare system and the effectiveness of diabetes management and preventive care programs.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of diabetic-related amputations is crucial for assessing the impact of diabetes on public health and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at controlling diabetes and preventing complications. High rates of amputations suggest inadequate diabetes management, lack of access to healthcare, or delayed treatment of complications.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Diabetic (NCD) Related Amputations,\" first collect data on the total number of amputations performed within the specified period that are attributed to diabetes complications. Verify that each amputation counted is directly related to diabetes by reviewing medical records or diagnoses. Finally, sum the total number of diabetic-related amputations within the period.\n\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Diabetic-Related Amputations = Sum of All Amputations Due to Diabetic Complications\n","SDGAlignment":"3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly & Annually ","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Number of Diabetic (NCD) related amputations","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-02-01"}
