This indicator reflects the output of these major commodities, which are critical to the country\u2019s economy and export markets.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the production levels of essential commodities such as beef, coconut oil, cocoa, copra, kava, wood, and coffee. These commodities are significant contributors to the agricultural and forestry sectors, which play a vital role in the country\u2019s economy. The production level is an important measure of the agricultural sector's performance, indicating the ability to meet domestic demand and contribute to exports. It also provides insights into the health of the sector, including productivity, resource availability, and market conditions.","Disaggregation":"Commodity, Country ","Rationale":"Monitoring the level of production of these major commodities is crucial for understanding the agricultural and forestry sectors' contributions to the national economy. These commodities are often key exports and sources of income for rural communities. A higher level of production typically indicates a robust and productive sector, which can enhance food security, generate employment, and increase export revenues. Conversely, a decline in production could signal challenges such as adverse weather conditions, resource constraints, or market disruptions.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Level of Production of Major Commodities Including Beef, Coconut Oil, Cocoa, Copra, Kava, Wood, and Coffee,\" first collect data on the total quantity and total value of each commodity produced during the reporting period. Sum the production quantities and values for each commodity to determine the total production level for each item. \n\nFormula:\nTotal Production Quantity= Total Production Quantity of (Beef + Coconut Oil + Cocoa + Copra + Kava)\nTotal Production Value= Total Production Value of (Beef + Coconut Oil + Cocoa + Copra + Kava)\n","SDGAlignment":"8.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Millions & Kilogram in Tons","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Level of production of major commodities to include cocoa and copra","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Total export values for Vanuatu's major commodities fluctuated between 2012 and 2021, peaking at 4.7 billion Vatu in 2017 before slightly declining to 4.5 billion in 2021. Kava emerged as the leading export commodity from 2016 onward, contributing over 2.4 billion Vatu in both 2020 and 2021. Copra and coconut oil showed significant variation, with copra exports falling from a high of 1.8 billion Vatu in 2017 to 845 million in 2021. The shifting composition of exports indicates rising reliance on high-value crops like kava, with declining trends for traditional bulk commodities like copra and coconut oil.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-07-01"}
