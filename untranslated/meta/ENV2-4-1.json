These facilities are designed to handle various types of waste in a manner that minimizes environmental impact, prevents contamination, and protects public health.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of waste disposal facilities that operate under controlled conditions. Controlled waste disposal facilities include sanitary landfills, incinerators, and specialized treatment plants that adhere to established guidelines for the safe and environmentally sound management of waste. The indicator reflects the infrastructure in place to manage waste in a manner that complies with legal and environmental regulations, ensuring that waste is processed, treated, and disposed of safely.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of controlled waste disposal facilities is essential for understanding a country's capacity to manage waste effectively and sustainably. Controlled facilities are critical for preventing environmental pollution, protecting public health, and ensuring that waste is managed in a way that minimizes its impact on the environment.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities,\" first gather data on all waste disposal facilities within the region or country from environmental agencies, local authorities, or waste management companies. Then, verify that each facility is operational and complies with environmental regulations and safety standards. Finally, count the total number of facilities that meet the criteria for being classified as controlled waste disposal facilities.\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities= Total Verified Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities","SDGAlignment":"11.6.1 & 11.6.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Infrastructure & Public Utilities ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Number of controlled wasted disposal facilities","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-04-01"}
