A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the risk of death associated with pregnancy and childbirth. The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is a critical indicator of the quality of a country\u2019s healthcare system, particularly its ability to provide effective maternal and reproductive health services. The number of maternal deaths is a raw count of the actual deaths that occur due to pregnancy-related causes within the specified period.","Disaggregation":"Region, Age","Rationale":"Monitoring the Maternal Mortality Ratio and the number of maternal deaths is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of maternal health programs and the accessibility and quality of healthcare services for women. High MMRs indicate a need for improved healthcare services, better access to skilled birth attendants, and enhanced maternal care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Maternal Mortality Ratio/Number of Maternal Deaths,\" first collect data on the total number of maternal deaths within the specified period. Then, obtain the total number of live births during the same period. Next, calculate the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) by dividing the number of maternal deaths by the total number of live births and multiply the result by 100,000 to express it per 100,000 live births. The number of maternal deaths can also be reported directly as a raw count.\n\nFormula:\nMaternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) = (Number of Maternal Deaths/Number of Live Births) * 100,000\n","SDGAlignment":"3.8.1, 3.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Ratio per 100,000 live births","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Maternal mortality ratio/Number of maternal deaths","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-01-02"}
