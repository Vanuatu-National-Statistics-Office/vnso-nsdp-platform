This includes payments to lawyers, court fees, expert witness fees, and other associated legal expenses.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the financial burden associated with accessing legal services in the court system. Legal fees can vary widely depending on the complexity of the case, the jurisdiction, the lawyer's experience, and other factors. Understanding the average cost provides insight into the affordability and accessibility of legal representation, which is a key component of the right to fair and equal access to justice.","Disaggregation":"Case type (criminal, civil, family, etc)","Rationale":"Monitoring the average cost of legal fees and services is crucial for assessing the affordability of the judicial system for the general population. High legal costs can be a significant barrier to justice, especially for low-income individuals and marginalized groups.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Average Cost of Legal Fees/Services for a Court Case,\" first collect data on the legal fees and associated costs for a representative sample of court cases. Classify the data by type of case and jurisdiction to account for cost variations. Then, sum the total legal costs for all sampled cases and divide by the total number of cases to determine the average cost. This provides insight into the financial burden of accessing legal services in the court system.\n\n\nFormula:\nAverage Cost of Legal Fees/Services = (Total Legal Fees/Service Costs for All Cases/Total Number of Cases)\n","SDGAlignment":"16.3.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Justice & Community Services","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Average cost of legal fees/services for a court case","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC5-01-03"}
