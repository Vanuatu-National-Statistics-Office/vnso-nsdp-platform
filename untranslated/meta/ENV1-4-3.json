These systems analyze soil types, topography, climate, and other environmental factors to identify the most suitable crops and farming systems for different regions within a country or area.","Concept":"This indicator focuses on the establishment of tools and methodologies that allow for the systematic assessment of land's agricultural potential. Land use capability mapping systems are essential for optimizing agricultural productivity by ensuring that land resources are used in a manner that maximizes crop yields and sustainability. These systems help in matching specific crops and farming practices to the most appropriate areas based on environmental conditions and land characteristics.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the establishment of land use capability mapping systems is crucial for promoting sustainable agriculture and efficient land use management. By aligning agricultural activities with the land's natural capabilities, these systems help to increase productivity, reduce environmental degradation, and promote the efficient use of resources. Monitoring this indicator helps assess the progress of efforts to enhance agricultural planning and sustainability through science-based land management practices.","MethodOfComputation":"Method of computation:\nTo assess the \"Establishment of Land Use Capability Mapping Systems to Determine Which Crops and Farming Systems Are Best Suited to Different Areas,\" first determine whether the mapping systems have been fully developed, including the analysis of environmental and soil factors. Then, verify that these systems are operational and being used to guide agricultural planning and decision-making. If the systems meet both criteria\u2014development and operational status\u2014they are categorized as \"established and operational.\"\n\n**Formula:**\nThis indicator is typically qualitative rather than quantitative, and it does not require a mathematical formula. Instead, it involves a checklist or categorical assessment based on the following criteria: mapping system development, implementation, and use\n","SDGAlignment":"12.8.1, 12.a.1 & 14.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Yes/No","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Lands & Natural Resources","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":true,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"The Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics launched an AI-driven land use capability mapping system in 2025 that uses machine learning and freely available open-source satellite imagery (such as Sentinel and Landsat) to automatically analyze and classify land cover.
