Compliance with the building code ensures that buildings are constructed safely, sustainably, and in a manner that protects the health and welfare of the occupants and the public.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the adherence of new buildings to the established building codes, which set out the minimum acceptable standards for construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, electrical and plumbing systems, energy efficiency, and accessibility. The building code is designed to ensure that all new buildings are constructed to a standard that guarantees safety, durability, and sustainability. By measuring compliance, this indicator provides insight into the effectiveness of building regulations and enforcement mechanisms.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of new buildings in compliance with the building code is crucial for ensuring public safety, environmental sustainability, and the long-term resilience of infrastructure. Buildings that do not comply with the code may pose significant risks, including structural failures, fire hazards, and other safety concerns. Compliance with building codes also promotes energy efficiency, accessibility, and environmental protection.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of New Buildings in Compliance with the Building Code,\" first collect data from building inspections to determine the number of new buildings that comply with the building code. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing the number of compliant buildings by the total number of new buildings inspected, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of New Buildings in Compliance= (Number of Compliant New Buildings/Total Number of New Buildings Inspected)*100\n","SDGAlignment":"9.1.1\n11.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of new buildings in compliance with the building code","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO2-03-01"}
