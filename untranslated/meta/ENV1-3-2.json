This indicator reflects the cost of food in the domestic market and is typically monitored on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis to track changes in food prices.","Concept":"This indicator provides an overview of the cost of food in a domestic economy, which is a key factor in assessing food affordability and accessibility for households. The basket of food items used for this indicator usually includes staple foods such as grains, vegetables, fruits, meat, dairy products, and other essential food products. The indicator helps to capture the fluctuations in food prices due to various factors, including supply and demand dynamics, inflation, production levels, import prices, and other economic conditions.","Disaggregation":"Food type","Rationale":"Monitoring the domestic food price level is crucial for understanding the economic burden of food on households, particularly low-income families. High food prices can lead to food insecurity, especially among low-income households, and can contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. Conversely, stable or decreasing food prices can improve access to nutrition and support economic stability.","MethodOfComputation":"Method of computation:\nTo compute the \"Domestic Food Price Level,\" first collect data on the prices of a basket of commonly consumed food items. Then, calculate the average price level by taking the weighted or unweighted average of the prices of these items. The weights, if used, should reflect the importance of each item in the average household's diet. This average represents the domestic food price level, which can be compared over time to monitor changes in food prices and assess their impact on food security and the cost of living.\n\nFormula:\n**Domestic Food Price Level = (Total Price of Food Itemi * Weighti/ Total Weighti)**\n","SDGAlignment":"2.b.1, 2.b.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.2 & 2.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Index","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Index","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Domestic food price level","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-03-02"}
