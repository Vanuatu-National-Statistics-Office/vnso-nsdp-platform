This indicator expresses the total public debt as a percentage of the country's GDP, providing an overview of the debt burden relative to the size of the economy.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the level of public debt, including liabilities incurred by SOEs, in relation to the overall economic output. The inclusion of SOE-generated debt in this measure ensures that all public sector liabilities are accounted for, offering a comprehensive view of the country's debt obligations. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a widely used metric to assess a country's ability to manage and repay its debt, as it relates the total debt to the economic output that can be leveraged for debt servicing.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the debt ratio to GDP, including SOE-generated debt, is crucial for assessing the fiscal health and sustainability of a country. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may indicate that a country could face difficulties in meeting its debt obligations without compromising economic growth, while a lower ratio suggests a more manageable debt burden. Including SOE debt provides a fuller picture of potential liabilities that could impact the government's finances.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Debt Ratio to GDP (Inclusive of SOE-Generated Debt),\" first collect data on the total public debt, including debt generated by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and the GDP for the same reporting period. Then, calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio by dividing the total public debt by the GDP\n\nFormula:\nDebt Ratio to GDP= Total Public Debt including SOE debt/GDP ","SDGAlignment":"17.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance and Treasury","source_organisation_2":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Debt ratio to GDP (inclusive of SOE generated debt)","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":null,"years":[{"year":null,"status":null,"image":null}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-03-02"}
