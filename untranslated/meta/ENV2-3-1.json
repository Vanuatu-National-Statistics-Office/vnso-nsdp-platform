These standards are typically defined by national or international energy efficiency certifications, such as ENERGY STAR, EU Energy Label, or similar.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the prevalence of energy-efficient appliances within the market, focusing specifically on imported lighting and refrigeration products. Energy efficiency standards are designed to reduce energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions by ensuring that appliances operate using less power while maintaining performance. By monitoring the proportion of energy-efficient imports, this indicator reflects the effectiveness of regulations, incentives, and consumer preferences in promoting sustainable energy use.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of energy-efficient lighting and refrigeration appliances is essential for promoting energy conservation, reducing electricity demand, and minimizing environmental impact. Energy-efficient appliances contribute to lower utility bills for consumers, reduced strain on the energy grid, and decreased carbon emissions.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of All Imported Lighting and Refrigeration Appliances That Meet High Energy Efficiency Standards,\" first collect data on the total number of lighting and refrigeration appliances imported into the country within a specific period. Then, gather information on how many of these imported appliances meet recognized high energy efficiency standards. Next, divide the number of energy-efficient appliances by the total number of imported appliances. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Energy-Efficient Imports (%) = (Number of Imported Appliances Meeting Energy Efficiency Standards/Total Number of Imported Appliances) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"7.1.2, 7.2.1, 7.3.1 & 7.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of all imported lighting and refrigeration appliances that meet high energy efficiency standards","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-03-01"}
