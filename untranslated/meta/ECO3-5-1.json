These reports may be produced by government agencies, research institutions, development organizations, or other entities.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the volume of research and analysis conducted on rural economies, which is crucial for understanding the economic dynamics, challenges, and opportunities in rural areas. Rural economic analysis reports typically cover topics such as agricultural productivity, rural employment, income levels, access to markets, infrastructure development, and the impact of policies on rural communities. The publication of these reports indicates the level of attention and resources devoted to understanding and improving rural economies, as well as the availability of data and insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Monitoring the total annual number of rural economic analysis reports published is important for assessing the depth and breadth of knowledge available on rural economic issues. A higher number of published reports suggests that there is a strong focus on rural economic development, with ample research and data available to inform decision-making and policy formulation. These reports are essential for identifying key trends, assessing the effectiveness of rural development programs, and providing evidence-based recommendations for improving rural economies.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Annual Number of Rural Economic Analysis Reports Published,\" first collect data on the number of reports focused on rural economic issues that were published during the reporting year. Verify that each report is relevant to rural economic analysis, and then sum the total number of eligible reports. This calculation provides insight into the extent of research and analytical attention given to rural economic conditions and developments within the specified period.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Reports Published= Total Rural Economic Analysis Reports Published in the Year\n","SDGAlignment":"2.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries & Biosecurity","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Total annual number of rural economic analysis reports published","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-05-01"}
