These indicators reflect women's autonomy, participation, and influence in different aspects of society.","Concept":"Women\u2019s empowerment is a multidimensional concept that includes economic independence, political participation, educational attainment, health, social status, and personal autonomy. Indicators of women\u2019s empowerment aim to capture these dimensions to assess how empowered women are within a specific context. Common indicators include women's participation in the workforce, access to education, representation in political bodies, control over resources, freedom from violence, and participation in decision-making processes.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring indicators of women\u2019s empowerment is crucial for assessing progress toward gender equality and understanding the barriers that women face in achieving full empowerment. These indicators provide insight into how well societies are supporting women in gaining the skills, opportunities, and autonomy needed to make decisions that affect their lives.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Indicators of Women\u2019s Empowerment,\" first select a set of specific indicators representing various dimensions of empowerment, such as economic participation, education, political leadership, health, and decision-making authority. Collect data on each of these indicators from relevant sources, such as national surveys, census data, and administrative records. Calculate and aggregate the individual indicator values to assess the overall level of women\u2019s empowerment, and track trends over time to measure progress. This composite assessment provides insights into how well women are being empowered in different areas of life.\n\nFormula:\nWomen\u2019s Labour Force Participation Rate (%) = (Number of Women in the Labour Force/Total Number of Women of Working Age) * 100\n\nProportion of Women in Leadership (%) = (Number of Women in Leadership Positions/Total Number of Leadership Positions) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.a.1 & 5.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"annually","source_organisation_1":"Public Service Commission ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-05","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Indicators of women\u2019s empowerment","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-01-03"}
