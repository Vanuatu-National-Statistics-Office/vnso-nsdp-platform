Traditional stories, dances, songs, and games are integral to a community\u2019s identity, social cohesion, and cultural continuity. They embody collective values, beliefs, and historical experiences, and their transmission from one generation to the next is essential for maintaining cultural heritage.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population with knowledge of traditional cultural practices is crucial for assessing the vitality of cultural heritage and the effectiveness of efforts to preserve and promote these traditions. As modern influences and globalization can lead to the erosion of traditional knowledge, this indicator helps identify areas where cultural practices may be declining and where revitalization efforts are needed.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Knowledge of Traditional Stories, Dances, Songs, and Games,\" first collect data through surveys or census to assess individuals' familiarity with these cultural expressions. Identify the number of respondents who demonstrate knowledge of traditional stories, dances, songs, and games. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of knowledgeable individuals by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\nFormula:\nProportion of Population with Cultural Knowledge (%) = (Number of Individuals with Knowledge of Traditional Stories, Dances, Songs and Games/Total Population Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4\n11.4.1(Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-05","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"%","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with knowledge of traditional stories, dances, songs, and games","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-02-01"}
