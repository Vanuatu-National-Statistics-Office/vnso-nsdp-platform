This indicator reflects the adoption and reliance on sustainable energy sources for household lighting needs.  ","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which households have transitioned from conventional, non-renewable energy sources (such as kerosene, coal, or grid electricity generated from fossil fuels) to renewable energy technologies for lighting. Renewable energy technologies offer a sustainable alternative that reduces dependence on fossil fuels, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and supports energy security. The indicator provides insights into the progress of energy transition efforts and the spread of clean energy technologies at the household level.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of households using renewable energy for lighting is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed at promoting clean energy adoption. High levels of renewable energy use for lighting contribute to environmental sustainability, reduce household energy costs, and improve access to reliable lighting, especially in remote or off-grid areas.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Households Using Renewable Energy Technology as Main Source of Lighting,\" first collect data on the total number of households within the region or country. Then, gather data on the number of households that use renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, or biogas, as their primary source of lighting. Next, divide the number of households using renewable energy for lighting by the total number of households. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Households Using Renewable Energy for Lighting (%) = (Number of Households Using Renewable Energy for Lighting/Total Number of Households) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"7.1.2, 7.2.1, 7.3.1 & 7.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-30","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"proportion of households","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of households using renewable energy technology as main source of lighting"},{"series":"Total number of households","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Total number using renewable energy for lighting"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-03-02"}
