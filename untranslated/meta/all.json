Ultimately, improving enrolment rates in Vanuatu is essential for its economic, social and environment development.\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"enrolments","goal_number":"enrolments","indicator_sort_order":"enrolments"},"labor":{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Labor Statistics","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu Labour Statistics","indicator_number":"labour statistics","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"A small nation like The Republic of Vanuatu located in the south pacific has its economy depending primarily on agriculture, tourism, and fishing. As a developing country labor statistics can play a crucial role in shaping the country's development goals. Here are some of the  significant  labor statistics in Vanuatu and how they can help the country achieve its development goals.\n\n1. Low employment rate\nVanuatu has a low employment rate of around 31%, and this can be seen as significant challenge  towards the country's development. this low employment rate can result  in limited job opportunities, lack of skills, or low education levels. To address this challenge, Vanuatu needs to invest in creating a conducive environment for businesses to grow, promoting entrepreneurship, and equipping the workforce with the  necessary skills for current labor market needs.\n\n2.High youth unemployment\nVanuatu also has a high youth unemployment rate of around 26%. Youth make up a significant portion of the population, and addressing their unemployment challenges is critical to the country's development. Encouraging entrepreneurship, vocational training, and promoting industries that can hire  and engage the youth can address this challenge.\n\n3.Informal sector dominance\nAround 80% of Vanuatu workforce is engaged in the informal sector, which often comes with low wages, limited job security, and poor working conditions. The government of Vanuatu can promote an enabling business environment, implement policies aimed at formalizing the informal sector, and offer incentives to the sector's actors to reduce the dominance of the informal sector in the economy.\n\n4.Gender gap\nVanuatu labor market experiences gender  gaps with women underrepresented in high-earning jobs or formal employment. Promoting gender equality, enacting laws that promote women's inclusion in the workforce, and creating awareness of gender disparities in the labor market can help bridge this gap.\n\nTherefore labor statistics play a crucial role in informing the country's development goals. Addressing the employment, youth employment, informal sector dominance, and gender equality may help Vanuatu bridge the economic disparities that deny many citizens access to essentials services and uplift their standards of  living.\n\n\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"labor","goal_number":"labor","indicator_sort_order":"labor"},"SOC3-3-3":{"indicator_number":"SOC3-3-3","goal_number":"SOC3","goal_name":"global_goals.SOC3-title","target_number":"SOC3-3","target_name":"global_targets.SOC3-3-title","indicator_name":"indicators.SOC3-3-3-title","PillarCode":"SOC","PillarDescription":"pillars.SOC","GoalId":"SOC3","GoalDescription":"global_goals.SOC3-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"SOC3-3","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.SOC3-3-title","IndicatorId":"SOC3-3-3","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.SOC3-3-3-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"No","Definition":"The \"Under-5 Mortality Rate\" indicator measures the probability that a child born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five, expressed per 1,000 live births.

These assessments are designed to evaluate students' knowledge and skills in relation to the defined benchmarks or expectations for their respective grade levels.\n\nMonitoring the percentage of students meeting literacy and numeracy standards helps education authorities, policymakers, and educators measure the  level of the effectiveness of educational programs, identify areas where additional support may be needed, and measure progress towards improving overall educational quality. It also serves as a means of addressing educational inequalities and ensuring that students acquire the fundamental skills necessary for their academic and lifelong success.","Concept":"It serves as an indicator to assess the academic achievement and progress of students in these foundational skills. This measurement is obtained through various assessments, such as standardized tests, and provides insights into students' abilities in areas such as reading comprehension, vocabulary, fluency, arithmetic, problem-solving, and critical thinking. ","Disaggregation":"Province, Sex","Rationale":"The rationale behind measuring the \"Percentage of students meeting literacy and numeracy standards\" lies in the importance of foundational skills for students' educational and lifelong success. By assessing the proportion of students who meet these standards, policymakers, educators, and stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the quality of education and identify areas that require improvement. This indicator helps in evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs and interventions, identifying achievement gaps, and addressing educational inequalities. It guides educational policies and resource allocation, enabling targeted support for students who may be falling behind in literacy and numeracy skills. Additionally, tracking the percentage of students meeting these standards helps ensure that all students are equipped with the necessary skills for further academic pursuits, employment, and active participation in society.","MethodOfComputation":"The computation method for the \"Percentage of students meeting literacy and numeracy standards\" involves several steps:\n\n1. Standard Setting: A set of criteria or benchmarks is established to define the expected level of proficiency in literacy and numeracy skills for students at different grade levels or educational stages. These criteria may be based on national or international standards, educational frameworks, or curriculum guidelines.\n\n2. Assessment Administration: Students are assessed using various evaluation methods, such as standardized tests, examinations, or assessments specifically designed to measure literacy and numeracy skills. These assessments are typically administered to all registered students throughout the entire country.\n\n3. Scoring and Proficiency Determination: The assessment results are scored based on predetermined scoring rubrics or criteria that align with the established standards. The scores provide a measure of each student's proficiency level in literacy and numeracy skills both in English & French.\n\n4. Calculation of Percentage: The percentage of students meeting the literacy and numeracy standards is computed by determining the proportion of students who achieve or exceed the proficiency benchmark. This is done by dividing the number of students who meet the standards by the total number of students assessed and multiplying the result by 100.\n\n5. Reporting and Analysis: The computed percentage is reported to stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and the public. It is often disaggregated by grade level, school, district, or other relevant demographics to identify variations and disparities in student performance.\n\nBy employing this computation method, education authorities can track the progress of students' literacy and numeracy skills over time, identify areas in need of improvement, and inform targeted interventions and policies to enhance educational outcomes in these fundamental areas.","SDGAlignment":"4.2, 4.2.1 (R) (Tier 2) & 4.3, 4.3.1 (Tier 2)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2016 - 202021  Annual Statistical Digest - MoE (Meeting and Exceeding Standard)","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-14","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"SOC2-03-01","graph_title":"global_indicators.SOC2-3-1-title"},"ECO1-5-1":{"indicator_number":"ECO1-5-1","goal_number":"ECO1","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO1-title","target_number":"ECO1-5","target_name":"global_targets.ECO1-5-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO1-5-1-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO1","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO1-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO1-5","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO1-5-title","IndicatorId":"ECO1-5-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO1-5-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"Yes (Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement Only)","Definition":"The \"Benefits/Value Accrued Through Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement Only\" indicator measures the economic gains or benefits that a country derives specifically from its participation in the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement.

Here's a general approach to calculating this indicator:\n\n1. Define the target population: Determine the specific population or geographic area for which you want to measure access to early warning technologies. It could be a national population, a specific region, or a community.\n\n2. Identify relevant technologies: Determine the technologies that are considered early warning systems in the context you are assessing. This may include mobile phones, internet access, radio and television networks, weather monitoring systems, etc.\n\n3. Collect data on technology access: Gather data on the availability and usage of the identified technologies within the target population. This can be obtained through surveys, census data, or existing reports from relevant agencies or organizations.\n\n4. Determine access criteria: Define the criteria for considering someone to have access to early warning technologies. For example, it could be based on ownership or regular usage of mobile phones, internet access at home or public facilities, access to radio or television broadcasts, etc.\n\n5. Calculate the proportion: Calculate the proportion of the target population that meets the access criteria for each technology. Divide the number of individuals with access by the total population and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n   Proportion = (Number of individuals with access / Total population) x 100\n\n6. Aggregate the proportions: If you are assessing multiple technologies, calculate the proportion for each technology separately, and then aggregate them to obtain an overall measure. This could be done by averaging the proportions or assigning different weights based on the significance of each technology.\n\n7. Interpretation and analysis: Analyze the calculated proportion to understand the level of access to early warning technologies within the population. Compare the results over time or across different regions or demographic groups to identify disparities, trends, or improvements in access.\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the measurement depend on the quality and representativeness of the data collected. Additionally, the specific context and objectives may require customization of the computation method.","SDGAlignment":"13.1, 13.1.1, 13.2.1 (R), (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"10 years","source_organisation_1":"2020 NPHC, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-29","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with access to technologies that conveys early warnings","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-02-02"},"shelter":{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Shelter Characteristics","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu Shelter characteristics","indicator_number":"Shelter Characteristics","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Shelter is another standalone indicator that the NSDP platform also wants to make its data more open to users in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the operational response and identify barriers to recovery, the aim was to monitor sheltering conditions, evaluate the utility of various shelter interventions, determine what gaps and needs continue to exist and finally, inform future preparedness and contingency planning.\n\n\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"shelter","goal_number":"shelter","indicator_sort_order":"shelter"},"ECO2-7-1":{"indicator_number":"ECO2-7-1","goal_number":"ECO2","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO2-title","target_number":"ECO2-7","target_name":"global_targets.ECO2-7-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO2-7-1-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO2","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO2-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO2-7","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO2-7-title","IndicatorId":"ECO2-7-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO2-7-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"No","Definition":"The \"Total Number of External Audits Undertaken to Establish Compliance with Conventions and Standards and Expose Non-Conformity\" indicator measures the total number of external audits conducted on transportation systems (including road, sea, and air transport) to assess their compliance with international and national conventions, standards, and regulations.
