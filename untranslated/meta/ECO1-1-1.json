Underlying inflation, also known as core inflation, typically excludes volatile items such as food and energy prices, providing a more stable measure of inflationary trends.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the change in underlying inflation, focusing on the sustained movements in prices of goods and services that are less susceptible to short-term volatility. The underlying inflation rate is an essential metric for policymakers and economists as it helps to gauge the true inflationary pressure in the economy, excluding temporary fluctuations that could distort the broader inflation picture","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Monitoring the change in the underlying inflation rate is crucial for assessing the stability of prices in an economy. Unlike headline inflation, which can be influenced by short-term price changes in volatile sectors, the underlying inflation rate offers a clearer view of long-term inflation trends. Understanding changes in the underlying inflation rate can help in making informed decisions to maintain price stability, guide interest rates, and manage economic growth.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Change in Underlying Inflation Rate (CPI Analysis),\" first collect data on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) components, focusing on the core basket of goods and services that exclude volatile items like food and energy. Then, calculate the underlying inflation rate based on these core components. Finally, determine the change in the underlying inflation rate by comparing the rate for the current period with that of the previous period, and express the change in percentage terms.\n\nFormula: \nChange in Underlying Inflation Rate= (Underlying Inflation Rate (current period) \u2013 Underlying Inflation Rate (previous period)/Underlying Inflation Rate (previous period))*100\n","SDGAlignment":"8.1\n8.1.1 (R)\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Quarterly","source_organisation_1":"December Consumer Price Index Update 2023 CPI, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-01","national_data_updated_date":"2025-07-02","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Change in underlying inflation rate (CPI analysis)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Vanuatu\u2019s underlying inflation rate remained below 2% from 2016 to 2022, indicating a period of relative price stability.
