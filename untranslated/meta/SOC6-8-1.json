This indicator reflects the extent to which aid is transparently incorporated into the government's financial planning and reporting processes.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the integration of external aid into the government's official budgetary framework. Aid to the government sector includes financial resources provided by external donors, including bilateral, multilateral, and international organizations, intended to support government programs and projects. Properly recording this aid in the government\u2019s budget ensures that all resources are accounted for, enhances transparency, and allows for better alignment of aid with national priorities.","Disaggregation":"Sector ","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of aid reported on the government\u2019s budget is crucial for assessing the transparency and accountability of government financial management. When aid is fully reported in the government\u2019s budget, it indicates that there is a clear and transparent process for tracking external resources, which is essential for effective planning, monitoring, and evaluation of government expenditures. Conversely, a lower percentage may indicate gaps in financial reporting, challenges in aid coordination, or a lack of integration between donor funds and the government\u2019s financial systems.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Aid to the Government Sector Reported on the Government\u2019s Budget,\" first collect data on the total amount of aid received by the government sector during the reporting period. Then, collect data on the amount of aid that is officially recorded in the government\u2019s budget for the same period. Divide the amount of aid reported in the budget by the total amount of aid received, and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Aid Reported on Budget (%) = (Aid Reported in the Government Budget/Total Aid Received by the Government Sector) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"10.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of aid the government sector reported on the government\u2019s budget","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC6-08-01"}
