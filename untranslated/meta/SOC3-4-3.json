Component 2 typically relates to a specific set of public health capacities required for effective disease prevention, detection, and response as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).","Concept":"This indicator tracks the progress of a country in meeting the public health capacities outlined in Component 2 of the IHR Index. The IHR is a legally binding agreement between countries to build and maintain core public health capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health events of international concern. Component 2 focuses on specific attributes such as surveillance, laboratory capacity, response readiness, or other essential health security measures.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of attributes attained based on the IHR Index Component 2 is crucial for assessing a country\u2019s preparedness and ability to manage public health risks and emergencies. High attainment indicates that the country is well-equipped to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats, thereby contributing to global health security. Conversely, low attainment may signal gaps in public health infrastructure and capabilities, necessitating targeted interventions.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Attributes Attained Based on International Health Regulation Index (IHR) Component 2,\" first identify the specific attributes required under Component 2 of the IHR Index. Then, assess the extent to which each attribute has been attained. Next, count the number of attributes that have been fully attained and divide this by the total number of attributes in Component 2. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Attributes Attained (%) = (Number of Fully Attained Attributes/Total Number of Attributes in IHR Component 2) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"3.c.1 & 3.d.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of attributes attained based on International Health Regulation Index (IHR) Component 2","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-04-03"}
