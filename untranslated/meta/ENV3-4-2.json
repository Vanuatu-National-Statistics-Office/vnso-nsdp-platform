These activities may include workshops, public campaigns, community engagement initiatives, collaborations with stakeholders, and educational outreach programs.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts made to promote climate change adaptation and resilience through communication and partnerships. Effective communication and partnership-building are critical for spreading knowledge, changing behaviours, and encouraging collective action to address climate challenges. The indicator reflects the commitment of governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to engage with communities, disseminate information, and build networks that support adaptation and resilience efforts.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of communication and partnership activities and awareness programs focused on climate change adaptation and resilience is essential for assessing the scope and effectiveness of public engagement efforts. These activities help to educate the public, foster collaboration among different sectors, and empower communities to take action in response to climate change.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Communication and Partnership Activities and Awareness Programs Established Targeting Issues Such as Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience,\" first identify and list all relevant activities and programs established within the specified period. Then, verify that each activity or program specifically targets climate change adaptation and resilience. Finally, count the total number of verified activities and programs.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Communication and Partnership Activities and Awareness Programs Established = Sum of All Verified Activities and Programs Targeting Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience\n","SDGAlignment":"13.3.1 & 13.3.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Climate Change & Adaptation","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of communication and partnership activities and awareness programs established targeting issues such as climate change adaptation and resilience","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-04-02"}
