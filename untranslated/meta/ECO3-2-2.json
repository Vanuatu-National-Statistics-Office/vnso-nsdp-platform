This indicator reflects the growth or decline in tourism activity based on the volume of visitors entering through airports and seaports.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the fluctuation in the number of tourists arriving by air and sea, providing a clear picture of trends in tourism demand. By monitoring both air and sea arrivals, the indicator captures the overall accessibility of a destination and the effectiveness of transportation infrastructure in supporting tourism. The indicator is useful for understanding the dynamics of tourism flows, including seasonal variations, the impact of marketing campaigns, and external factors such as economic conditions, travel restrictions, or global events.","Disaggregation":"Mode of Arrival","Rationale":"Monitoring the annual change in tourism by air and sea arrivals is crucial for assessing the performance and growth of the tourism sector. A positive change indicates an increase in the number of tourists, which can lead to greater economic benefits, including higher spending, job creation, and increased demand for tourism-related services. Conversely, a negative change may signal challenges such as decreased competitiveness, unfavourable economic conditions, or external shocks.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Annual Change in Tourism by Air and Sea Arrivals,\" first collect data on the total number of tourists arriving by air and sea for the current and previous years. Calculate the change by subtracting the previous year\u2019s total from the current year\u2019s total. Then, divide the change by the previous year\u2019s total and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage, representing the annual growth or decline in tourism arrivals.\n\nFormula:\nAnnual Change in Tourism by Air (%)= ((Total Arrivals in Current Year \u2013 Total Arrivals in Previous Year)/Total Arrivals in Previous Year)*100\nAnnual Change in Tourism by Sea Arrivals (%)= ((Total Arrivals in Current Year \u2013 Total Arrivals in Previous Year)/Total Arrivals in Previous Year)*100\n","SDGAlignment":"8.9.1\n8.9.2\n17.17.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Department of Immigration","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-31","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Change in arrivals","unit":"Change in number of arrivals","title":"Annual change in tourism by air and sea arrivals"},{"series":"Total number of arrivals","unit":"Total number of arrivals","title":"Total number of  tourist arrivals by sea and air"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-02-02"}
