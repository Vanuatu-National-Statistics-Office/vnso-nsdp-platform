This balance indicates whether the country has a trade surplus (exports exceed imports) or a trade deficit (imports exceed exports) with each of its key trading partners.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the trade relationships between a country and its major trading partners by calculating the balance of trade for each partner. The balance of trade is a critical component of a country\u2019s current account and reflects the competitiveness of its goods and services in international markets. By focusing on major trading partners, this indicator provides insights into the bilateral trade dynamics that are most significant to the country\u2019s economy.","Disaggregation":"Country","Rationale":"Monitoring the balance of trade by major partner countries is crucial for understanding the structure of a country's external trade and its economic relationships with key international markets. A trade surplus with a major partner may indicate a strong competitive position in that market, while a trade deficit could suggest reliance on imports or challenges in export performance.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Balance of Trade by Major Partner Countries,\" first identify the country\u2019s major trading partners based on trade volume and value. Then, collect data on the total value of exports to and imports from each of these partners for the specified period. Calculate the trade balance for each partner by subtracting the value of imports from the value of exports. A positive balance indicates a trade surplus, while a negative balance indicates a trade deficit.\n\nFormula:\nTrade Balance with Country X= Value of Exports to Country X \u2013 Value of Imports from Country X\n","SDGAlignment":"17.11.1\n","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue Department","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-09","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-19","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Balance of trade by major partner countries","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"From 2016 to 2020, Vanuatu recorded sustained trade deficits, with annual balances ranging from -44.4 billion to -29.3 billion Vatu. The narrowing deficit over time suggests a modest improvement in the balance between imports and exports, though the country remained a net importer throughout the period. While disaggregated data by partner country is unavailable, these aggregate trends indicate the need to strengthen export competitiveness.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.sunny","image":"sunny.png"},{"year":2020,"status":"progress.sunny","image":"sunny.png"},{"year":2019,"status":"progress.sunny","image":"sunny.png"},{"year":2018,"status":"progress.sunny","image":"sunny.png"},{"year":2017,"status":"progress.sunny","image":"sunny.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-03"}
