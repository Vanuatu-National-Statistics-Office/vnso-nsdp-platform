Alternatively, the \"Proportion of Licensee Operations Being Monitored\" indicator measures the percentage of licensed operations that are actively monitored to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including quota adherence.","Concept":"These indicators track compliance and enforcement within resource extraction industries. The \"Proportion of Licensees Harvesting Within Their Allocated Quota\" focuses on the extent to which licensees adhere to the resource limits assigned to them, ensuring sustainable resource use. The \"Proportion of Licensee Operations Being Monitored\" reflects the level of oversight by regulatory authorities to ensure that operations are conducted legally and sustainably.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring these indicators is essential for ensuring sustainable management of natural resources. Compliance with quotas helps prevent over-extraction, protects ecosystems, and maintains the long-term viability of resources. Effective monitoring of licensee operations ensures that regulations are enforced, reducing the likelihood of illegal activities and over-harvesting.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Licensees Harvesting Within Their Allocated Quota,\" first gather data on the total number of licensed operators and the number of those adhering to their quotas. Then, divide the number of compliant licensees by the total number of licensees and multiply by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nTo compute the \"Proportion of Licensee Operations Being Monitored,\" first collect data on the total number of licensed operations and the number being actively monitored. Then, divide the number of monitored operations by the total number of licensee operations and multiply by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Licensees Complying with Quotas (%) = (Number of Licenses Harvesting Within Quota/Total Number of Licenses) * 100\n\nProportion of Licensees being Monitored (%) = (Number of Licenses Monitored/Total Number of Licenses) * 100\n\n","SDGAlignment":"15.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Forestry ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of licensees harvesting within their allocated quota or Proportion of licensee operations being monitored","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-06-02"}
