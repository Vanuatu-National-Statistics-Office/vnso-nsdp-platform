This indicator reflects the country\u2019s compliance with its international environmental responsibilities.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the fulfilment of a country\u2019s environmental obligations under international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Basel Convention on hazardous wastes, and others. These obligations may include reporting requirements, implementation of specific environmental policies, reduction targets, conservation efforts, and other commitments. The indicator provides insights into how effectively a country is adhering to its international environmental commitments and contributing to global environmental goals.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"This Study will try to depict the proportion of environmental obligations within the international convention and treaties that are being met inside Vanuatu. The data collected will be analysed to measure the progress of environmental institutions and its governance towards meeting national and international standards. To determine whether or not Vanuatu\u2019s economy can foster sustainable growth and development through low impact industries and modern technologies to ensure the well-being of future generations.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Environmental Obligations Within International Conventions and Treaties Met,\" first identify and list all the environmental obligations and commitments the country has under the international conventions and treaties it has ratified. Then, assess the country\u2019s compliance with each obligation to determine whether it has been fully met, partially met, or not met. Next, divide the number of fully met obligations by the total number of obligations identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of obligations met as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Obligations Met (%) = (Number of Fully Met Obligations/Total Number of Obligations Within Conventions and Treaties) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of environmental obligations within international conventions and treaties met","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-05-02"}
