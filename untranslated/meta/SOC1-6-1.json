These modules focus on educating students about the cultural history, traditions, and heritage of their country or region.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the adoption and implementation of educational content that promotes cultural awareness and preservation within the public school system. The culture and heritage modules are designed to help students understand and appreciate their cultural identity, heritage, and the diverse traditions that shape their society. The indicator reflects the extent to which these important topics are being taught in schools, ensuring that cultural education is a core component of the national curriculum.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of public schools using culture and heritage modules is essential for assessing the effectiveness of efforts to integrate cultural education into the national curriculum. Teaching students about their cultural heritage is key to fostering a sense of identity, pride, and continuity within communities. It also supports the preservation of cultural knowledge and practices that might otherwise be at risk of being forgotten.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Public Schools Using the Culture and Heritage Modules in National Curriculum at All Levels,\" first identify all public schools within the educational system. Verify whether each school has integrated culture and heritage modules into their curriculum at all levels by reviewing relevant school and curriculum documents. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of schools using the modules by the total number of public schools, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Schools Using Culture and Heritage Modules (%) = (Number of Schools Using Culture and Heritage Modules/Total Number of Public Schools) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education & Training ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-14","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of public schools using the culture and heritage modules in national curriculum at all levels","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-06-01"}
