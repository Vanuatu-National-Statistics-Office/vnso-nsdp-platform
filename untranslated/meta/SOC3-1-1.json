This indicator reflects the availability of essential health personnel relative to the population size.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of skilled health professionals within a population, which is crucial for providing adequate healthcare services. Skilled health professionals include individuals who have received formal training and certification in health-related fields and are capable of delivering medical care, diagnosing and treating illnesses, and providing preventive healthcare. The ratio of health professionals to the population is a key metric for assessing the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the needs of the population.","Disaggregation":"Region, Type of Health Professional ","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of skilled health professionals per 10,000 population is essential for evaluating the adequacy of healthcare services and the accessibility of medical care. A higher ratio indicates better access to healthcare, which is critical for improving health outcomes, reducing mortality rates, and ensuring that the population receives timely and effective medical care.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Skilled Health Professionals per 10,000 Population,\" first gather data on the total number of skilled health professionals in Vanuatu. Then, obtain the total population data for the area being assessed. Calculate the ratio by dividing the total number of health professionals by the total population, and multiply the result by 10,000 to express the number per 10,000 population.\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Skilled Health Professionals per 10,000 Population = (Total Number of Skilled Health Professionals/Total Population) * 10,000\n","SDGAlignment":"3.1.1,\n3.1.2,\n3.7.1,\n3.7.2\n","UnitOfMeasurement":"Ratio per 10,000 population","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2025-07-27","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Number of skilled health professionals to 10,000 population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-01-01"}
