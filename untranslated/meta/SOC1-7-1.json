This access is typically rooted in customary rights and practices that have been established over generations within indigenous or local communities.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which individuals and communities maintain access to their traditional lands and natural resources, including forests and marine areas. These resources are vital for livelihoods, cultural practices, and community well-being. Access to traditional lands and resources is often governed by customary laws and traditions, which dictate how resources are used, managed, and shared among community members.","Disaggregation":"Region, Sex","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population with free access to traditional lands, forest, and marine resources is essential for understanding the status of customary rights and the sustainability of traditional practices. Access to these resources is critical for food security, cultural identity, and economic activities in many indigenous and local communities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Free Access to Traditional Lands, Forest, and Marine Resources,\" first collect data through surveys or community assessments to determine individuals' access to these resources. Identify the number of respondents who report having free and unrestricted access. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of individuals with free access by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population with Free Access (%) = (Number of Individuals with Free Access to Traditional Lands, Forests, and Marine Resources/Total Population Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 Years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-14","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-25","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"%","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with free access to traditional lands, forest and marine resources","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"approaching_target","reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-07-01"}
