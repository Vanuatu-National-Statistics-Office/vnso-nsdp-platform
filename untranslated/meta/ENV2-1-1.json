These policies typically address issues such as marine conservation, sustainable fisheries, renewable energy, biodiversity protection, sustainable agriculture, and pollution control. The indicator provides insights into the country's commitment to and progress in achieving sustainable development goals through the integration of environmental and economic policies.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the implementation of blue-green growth-friendly policies is critical for assessing a country\u2019s efforts to achieve sustainable development. Fully implementing these policies is essential for balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, ensuring that natural resources are preserved for future generations. This indicator helps policymakers, stakeholders, and the public understand the effectiveness of government initiatives aimed at promoting sustainability, identify gaps in policy implementation, and guide future actions to enhance environmental stewardship while fostering economic growth.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of 'Blue-Green Growth Friendly' National Policies Fully Implemented,\" first identify and compile a list of all national policies that are classified as \"blue-green growth friendly.\" Then, assess the implementation status of each policy to determine whether it has been fully implemented. Next, divide the number of fully implemented policies by the total number of such policies identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Policies Fully Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented Blue-Green Growth Policies/Total Number of Identified Blue-Green Growth Policies) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"7.a.1, 15.9.1 & 15.a.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic, Policy, Planning & Aid Coordination","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of 'blue-green growth friendly' national policies fully implemented","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"},{"year":2020,"status":"progress.rainy","image":"rainy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-01-01"}
