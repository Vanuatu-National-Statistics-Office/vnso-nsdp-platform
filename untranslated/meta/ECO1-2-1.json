Government revenue includes all income generated by the government from taxes, fees, fines, grants, and other sources of public funds.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the fluctuation in government revenue over time, providing insights into the government's fiscal capacity and its ability to fund public services, infrastructure, and development programs. The GFS tables are standardized financial reports used by governments worldwide to present detailed information on government revenue, expenditure, and financing in a consistent and comparable format","Disaggregation":"Type of Government Revenue","Rationale":"Monitoring the change in government revenue is crucial for understanding the fiscal health and sustainability of a government. An increase in revenue may indicate economic growth, improved tax collection, or successful policy measures, while a decrease may signal economic challenges, reduced tax base, or inefficiencies in revenue collection.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Change in Government Revenue (GFS Tables),\" first collect data on total government revenue for the current year and the previous year from the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) tables. Then, calculate the change in revenue by subtracting the previous year's total revenue from the current year's total revenue. If expressing the change as a percentage, divide the difference by the previous year's total revenue and multiply by 100.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage Change in Government Revenue= (Total Revenue (Current Year) \u2013 Total Revenue (Previous Year)/ Total Revenue (Previous Year))*100\n\n","SDGAlignment":"17.1.1\n17.1.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance and Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2022-02-08","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Change in government revenue (GFS Tables)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Government revenue in Vanuatu rose from 15.8 billion Vatu in 2011 to over 42 billion in 2020, marking an overall increase of more than 160% over the decade.
