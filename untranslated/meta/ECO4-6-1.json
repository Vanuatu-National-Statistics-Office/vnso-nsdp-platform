This indicator provides insights into the distribution of labour across different sectors and reflects the level of economic activity within each sector.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the engagement of the labour force within different sectors of the economy, highlighting how the workforce is distributed across agriculture, industry, and services. Labour force participation refers to the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. By analysing participation by sector, this indicator helps to understand the structure of the economy, the dominant sectors in terms of employment, and the shifts in labour force distribution over time, which can indicate economic development, industrialization, or sectoral changes.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring labour force participation by sector is essential for understanding the dynamics of the labour market and the economy\u2019s structure. A higher participation rate in a particular sector may indicate the sector\u2019s significance to the economy and its capacity to generate employment. Conversely, a decline in participation in a sector may signal challenges such as declining profitability, technological changes, or shifts in market demand.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Labour Force Participation by Sector,\" first collect data on the number of individuals employed or actively seeking employment in each sector of the economy. Then, obtain the total labour force, including all sectors. Calculate the participation rate for each sector by dividing the number of individuals in that sector by the total labour force and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nLabour Force Participation Rate by Sector (%) = (Number of Individuals in Sector X/Total Labour Force) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"8.8.1\n8.8.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics\n","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery"},{"series":"Industry","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Industry"},{"series":"Service","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Service"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-06-01"}
