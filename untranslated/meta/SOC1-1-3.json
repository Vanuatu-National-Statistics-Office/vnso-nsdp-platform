Documentation includes the systematic recording of the language\u2019s vocabulary, grammar, oral traditions, and other linguistic and cultural features, often in written, audio, or digital formats.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts to preserve endangered languages by documenting them before they potentially become extinct. Endangered languages are those at risk of falling out of use, typically because their speakers are declining in number, or they are shifting to more dominant languages. Documentation is a critical step in preserving the linguistic heritage, providing a resource for language revitalization, and ensuring that future generations have access to the language.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of endangered languages that have been documented is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of language preservation initiatives. Documentation is crucial for maintaining linguistic diversity and cultural heritage, as it captures the knowledge, history, and identity embedded in endangered languages.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Endangered Languages Documented,\" first identify and list all languages classified as endangered within the specified region or country. Then, verify whether each endangered language has been documented by checking for comprehensive records in written, audio, or digital formats. Next, divide the number of documented endangered languages by the total number of endangered languages identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Endangered Languages Documented (%) = (Number of Documented Endangered Languages/Total Number of Endangered Languages) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5 - 10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Cultural Centre","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-06-23","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"% (percentage)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"Source: Vanuatu Cultural Center","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of endangered languages documented","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-01-03"}
