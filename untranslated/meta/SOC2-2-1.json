Effective implementation and management include appropriate allocation, utilization, reporting, and monitoring of grant funds to support educational activities and improve school performance.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the ability of schools to manage financial resources provided through grants efficiently and transparently. School grants are often allocated to support specific educational goals, such as improving infrastructure, acquiring teaching materials, and enhancing student learning outcomes. Effective management of these grants is crucial to ensure that funds are used appropriately and achieve the intended impact.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of schools demonstrating effective implementation and management of school grants is essential for assessing the overall accountability and financial management capacity within the education sector. Proper use of school grants is key to improving educational quality and ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most needed.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Schools Demonstrating Effective Implementation and Management of School Grants,\" first establish specific criteria for effective grant management. Conduct audits or evaluations to identify which schools meet these criteria. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of schools that demonstrate effective grant management by the total number of schools that received grants, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Schools Demonstrating Effective Grant Management (%) = (Number of Schools Meeting Grant Management Criteria/Total Number of Schools Receiving Grants) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"4.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education & Training ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of schools demonstrating effective implementation and management of school grants","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC2-02-01"}
