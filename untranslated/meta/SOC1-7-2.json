These activities are carried out either for subsistence (consumption) or for customary purposes, which may include cultural practices, rituals, or community obligations.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which traditional lands are used by communities for essential livelihoods and cultural practices. Traditional lands are areas that have been historically and culturally significant to indigenous and local communities, providing resources for food, shelter, and cultural activities. The use of these lands for agriculture, marine activities, forestry, and livestock is deeply rooted in the customs and traditions of the community, often governed by customary laws and practices.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that uses traditional lands for agriculture, marine, forestry, and livestock activities is crucial for understanding the sustainability of traditional livelihoods and the preservation of cultural heritage. The continued use of traditional lands for these purposes indicates the resilience of cultural practices and the reliance of communities on these resources for their well-being.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population that Use Traditional Lands for Agriculture, Marine, Forestry, and Livestock for Consumption or Customary Purposes,\" first design a survey to assess whether individuals or households engage in these activities on traditional lands. Then, administer the survey to a representative sample of the population and analyse the responses to determine the number of respondents who use traditional lands for these purposes. Next, divide the number of respondents who engage in these activities by the total number of survey respondents. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population Using Traditional Lands (% )= (Number of Individuals Using Traditional Lands for Agriculture, Marine, Forestry, or Livestock Activities/Total Population Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 Years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-14","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-25","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"%","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Agriculture","unit":"(%) Percentage of traditional lands used","title":"Proportion of population that use traditional lands for Agriculture"},{"series":"Forestry","unit":"(%) percentage of traditional lands used","title":"Proportion of population that use traditional lands for Forestry"},{"series":"Livestock","unit":"(%) percentage of traditional lands used","title":"Proportion of population that use traditional lands for Livestock"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-07-02"}
