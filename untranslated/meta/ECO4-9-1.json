These joint ventures typically involve shared ownership, management, and risks between the public and private partners.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the collaboration between public and private sectors through joint ventures, which are strategic alliances aimed at leveraging the strengths of both sectors to achieve common goals. Public/private joint ventures are often formed to undertake large-scale projects, such as infrastructure development, resource management, or service delivery, where both parties contribute resources, expertise, and capital. By counting the number of such ventures in operation, the indicator provides insight into the level of public-private collaboration and the role of these partnerships in driving economic development and public service provision.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of public/private joint ventures in operation is essential for understanding the extent of collaboration between the public and private sectors in achieving economic and developmental objectives. A higher number of joint ventures may indicate a strong partnership between the two sectors, leading to enhanced resource mobilization, innovation, and efficient project execution. These ventures can be crucial in addressing infrastructure gaps, improving public services, and fostering economic growth","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of Public/Private Joint Ventures in Operation,\" first collect data on the total number of joint ventures involving public and private sector entities that are currently active within the country or region. Verify that these joint ventures are operational, meaning they are engaged in ongoing business activities or projects. Finally, sum the total number of verified active joint ventures to determine the overall count.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number Public/Private Joint Ventures in Operation = Total Active Public/Private Joint Ventures in Vanuatu\n","SDGAlignment":"17.17.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2025-07-27","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total number of public/private joint ventures in operation","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-09-01"}
