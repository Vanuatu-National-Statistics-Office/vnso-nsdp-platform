Agricultural extension services include educational programs, technical assistance, and resources provided to farmers and agricultural workers to improve their farming practices and productivity.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the accessibility and availability of agricultural extension services, which are critical for disseminating knowledge, technologies, and practices to farmers and other agricultural stakeholders. Agricultural extension services include training, technical assistance, and information dissemination provided by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, or private sector entities to support agricultural development. By expressing the data on a per capita basis and disaggregating it by province, the indicator helps assess the distribution and equity of service delivery across different regions.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the total annual number of agricultural extension services per capita by province is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of agricultural support programs and ensuring that farmers and rural communities have adequate access to the resources and knowledge they need to improve productivity, sustainability, and resilience. Extension services play a crucial role in promoting best practices, adopting new technologies, and addressing challenges such as pest management, soil fertility, and climate change adaptation.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Annual Number of Agricultural Extension Services Per Capita by Province,\" first collect data on the total number of agricultural extension services provided within each province during the reporting year. Then, obtain the population data for each province. Calculate the per capita value by dividing the total number of extension services by the population of the province. \n\nFormula\nAgricultural Extension Services Per Capita (Province X)= (Total Number of Extension Services in Province X/Total Population of Province X)\n","SDGAlignment":"2.3.1\n2.3.2\n2.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Services per capita (ratio)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries & Biosecurity","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Total annual number of agricultural extension services per capita by province","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-04-01"}
