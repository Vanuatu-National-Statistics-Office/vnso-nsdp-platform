Obesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher, where BMI is calculated as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters (kg/m\u00b2).","Concept":"This indicator tracks the prevalence of obesity within the adult population, which is a significant public health concern. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of numerous health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and certain types of cancer. The prevalence of obesity is an important measure of the overall health and nutritional status of a population, as well as a key indicator of the effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic diseases.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the prevalence of obesity in the adult population is essential for assessing the burden of obesity-related health conditions and the effectiveness of public health policies and programs. High prevalence rates may indicate a need for enhanced efforts to promote healthy eating, physical activity, and weight management within the population","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Prevalence of Obesity in Adult Population,\" first collect data on the height and weight of adults to calculate their BMI. Classify individuals as obese if their BMI is 30 or higher. Calculate the prevalence by dividing the number of obese adults by the total number of adults surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPrevalence of Obesity (%) = ((Number of Obese adults (BMI \u2265 30))/Total Number of Adults Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"3.b.1, 3.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-04","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"prevalence obesity of adult population (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Prevalence of obesity in adult population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years where prevalence rate data is available","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-03-02"}
