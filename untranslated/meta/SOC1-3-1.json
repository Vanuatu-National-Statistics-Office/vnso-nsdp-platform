These sites may include monuments, buildings, landscapes, archaeological sites, and other locations of importance to a community's heritage.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts made to identify, protect, and preserve sites that hold cultural or historical value. The process involves recognizing sites for their significance, officially registering them to ensure legal protection, and implementing measures to conserve and maintain them. The indicator reflects the commitment of governments, cultural institutions, and communities to safeguarding their heritage and ensuring that significant sites are protected for future generations.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of culturally and historically significant sites that are newly identified, registered, and preserved is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of heritage conservation efforts. The preservation of these sites is vital for maintaining cultural identity, educating the public, and promoting tourism.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of Sites with Cultural and/or Historical Significance Newly Identified, Registered, and Preserved,\" first identify and list all sites that have been newly recognized as culturally or historically significant within the specified period. Then, verify that each site has been officially registered with the relevant authorities and confirm that preservation measures have been implemented. Finally, count the total number of sites that meet these criteria.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Newly Identified, Registered, and Preserved Sites = Sum of All Verified Sites with Cultural/Historical Significance Newly Registered and Preserved \n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Cultural Centre","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-14","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total number of sites with cultural and/or historical significance newly identified, registered and preserved","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-03-01"}
