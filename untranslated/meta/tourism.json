{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cVisitor Arrivals by Mode of Transport, Purpose of Visit, and Country of Residence\u201d measures the total number of visitors arriving in the country, disaggregated by mode of transport (e.g. cruise, plane), purpose of visit (e.g. holiday, business, visiting friends), and country of usual residence. It provides a comprehensive picture of tourism inflows and visitor characteristics.","Concept":"Tourism arrivals are a key metric for economic development, service sector performance, and foreign exchange earnings, especially in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Disaggregating arrivals by mode of entry helps assess infrastructure needs (airports vs. ports), while purpose of visit offers insight into the structure of demand (leisure, business, family). Country of residence allows analysis of target markets, seasonality, and geopolitical trends.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Tourism is a vital sector for employment, economic diversification, and cultural exchange. Tracking visitor arrivals supports planning and investment in tourism infrastructure, services, and marketing. Growth in total arrivals may reflect improved connectivity, promotion, or global travel conditions. Changes in purpose or origin may suggest shifts in demand, international relations, or niche market opportunities.","MethodOfComputation":"Total Visitor Arrivals: Sum of all arrivals recorded at points of entry, regardless of purpose or origin.\nMode of Transport: Count of arrivals recorded as entering by cruise ship, plane (residents and visitors separately).\nPurpose of Visit: Total number of arrivals classified under each purpose category.\nCountry of Residence: Total number of visitors whose usual country of residence is reported.\n\nFormula: \nTotal Arrivals (per year) = \u03a3 (all visitor entries at all borders)\nArrivals by Mode = \u03a3 (entries by cruise, plane \u2013 residents, plane \u2013 visitors)\nArrivals by Purpose = \u03a3 (holiday + business + visiting friends + other)\nArrivals by Country = \u03a3 (visitors from each reported country of residence)\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs and Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Tourism Insights","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Visitor Arrivals by Mode of Transport, Purpose of Visit, and Country of Residence","indicator_number":"Vanuatu Tourism","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Trade- Tourism\nVisitor arrivals by plane steadily increased from 62,000 in 2005 to a peak of 121,000 in 2019, before collapsing to zero in 2021 due to COVID-19 border closures. A gradual recovery began in 2022, with 59,000 visitors arriving by plane in 2024\u2014still just half of pre-pandemic levels. Prior to the pandemic, most air arrivals came for holidays, primarily from Australia and New Zealand. The data underscores both the resilience and vulnerability of the tourism sector, and the importance of rebuilding air connectivity and confidence among key source markets.\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years with latest available data","target_number":"tourism","goal_number":"tourism","indicator_sort_order":"tourism"}
