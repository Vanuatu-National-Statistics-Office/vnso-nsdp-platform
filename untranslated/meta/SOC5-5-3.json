This assessment is typically gathered through surveys or community feedback mechanisms.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the level of public confidence in traditional leadership, specifically focusing on the chief's role as a mediator and conflict resolver. Chiefs often hold significant authority in many communities and are responsible for maintaining social order and harmony. The ability to resolve disputes peacefully is a key component of their leadership, contributing to community stability and cohesion.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that has a positive assessment of their chief's ability to resolve disputes is important for understanding the effectiveness of traditional leadership in conflict resolution. High levels of confidence in a chief's dispute resolution abilities indicate strong community trust and the effectiveness of traditional governance structures. Conversely, low levels of confidence may suggest the need for enhanced conflict resolution training, support for traditional leaders, or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Positive Assessment of Their Chief's Ability to Resolve Disputes Peacefully,\" first design and administer a survey to a representative sample of the population, asking respondents to rate their confidence in their chief's ability to resolve disputes peacefully. Then, identify the number of respondents who provide a positive assessment. Divide this number by the total number of respondents and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Positive Assessments (%) = (Number of Positive Assessments/Total Number of Respondents) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Cultural Center","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of population with positive assessment of their chief's ability to resolve disputes peacefully","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC5-05-03"}
