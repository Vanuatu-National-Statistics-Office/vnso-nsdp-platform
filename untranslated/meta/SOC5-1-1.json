This includes projects, programs, and reforms aimed at building capacity within the justice and community services sectors.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the progress made in implementing the strategic initiatives designed to enhance the capacity of the justice and community services sectors. Capacity development in this context refers to strengthening the skills, competencies, and abilities of individuals, institutions, and systems within these sectors to deliver effective and equitable services to the public.","Disaggregation":"Activity type","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the strategy implemented is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity Development Strategy 2017-2020. A high proportion indicates successful execution of planned activities, contributing to improved service delivery, better governance, and enhanced access to justice and community services. Conversely, a low proportion may signal challenges such as resource constraints, lack of coordination, or other barriers to implementation.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity Development Strategy 2017-2020 Implemented,\" first identify and list all planned activities and initiatives detailed in the strategy. Then, collect data on the number of these activities that have been fully or partially implemented during the specified period. Next, divide the number of implemented activities by the total number of planned activities. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of the strategy implemented as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Strategy Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented Activities/Total Number of Planned Activities) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"16.3.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Justice & Community Services","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity Development Strategy 2017-2020 implemented","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC5-01-01"}
