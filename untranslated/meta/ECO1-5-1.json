This includes increased trade, investment, and other economic activities that are directly attributable to the preferential trade terms and cooperation facilitated by the MSG Trade Agreement.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the economic impact of the MSG Trade Agreement, which is a regional trade pact aimed at promoting economic cooperation, trade liberalization, and integration among Melanesian countries. The value accrued through this agreement refers to the tangible benefits, such as increased exports, imports, investment flows, job creation, and economic growth, that are directly linked to the trade provisions of the MSG agreement. The focus is exclusively on benefits derived from the MSG Trade Agreement, excluding any other trade agreements or economic arrangements.","Disaggregation":"Country","Rationale":"Monitoring the benefits or value accrued through the MSG Trade Agreement is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of regional trade agreements in promoting economic development and integration among Melanesian countries. By quantifying the economic gains from this agreement, policymakers and stakeholders can evaluate the success of the trade agreement in achieving its objectives, such as boosting intra-regional trade, enhancing market access, and fostering economic cooperation.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Benefits/Value Accrued Through Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement Only,\" first identify and categorize the economic benefits specifically related to increased trade volumes. Focus on measuring these trade benefits in terms of both value (monetary worth) and volume (physical quantities). Collect data on the value and volume of goods exported and imported under the MSG Trade Agreement. Ensure that this data is directly attributable to the MSG Trade Agreement. Aggregate the total trade value and volume associated with the agreement over the specified period.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Trade Value (MSG)= Total Value of Exports (MSG) + Total Value of Imports (MSG)\nTotal Trade Volume (MSG)= Total Volume of Exports (MSG) + Total Volume of Imports (MSG)\n","SDGAlignment":"17.11.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue Department","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Benefits/value accrued through various trade agreements","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-01"}
