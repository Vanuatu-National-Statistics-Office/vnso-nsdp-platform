{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cExports by Commodity and Country\u201d measures the total value, quantity, and unit price of goods exported from the country, disaggregated by commodity type and destination country. It reflects the composition and destination of national export flows.","Concept":"The indicator is based on the concept of export-led growth and trade performance monitoring. Exports are a critical driver of economic development, foreign exchange earnings, and sectoral competitiveness. Disaggregating exports by commodity allows for sector-specific insights (e.g. agriculture, manufacturing), while analysis by country reveals trading relationships, market access, and export concentration risk. The inclusion of unit prices enables assessment of product competitiveness and value-addition trends.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring exports is essential to understand how the national economy engages in international markets. Increases in export value may reflect improved global demand, increased production, or enhanced trade terms. Tracking exports by product supports sectoral planning (e.g. boosting cocoa or kava exports), while tracking by country highlights dependency on specific markets or emerging trade opportunities. Unit prices provide further context, helping identify price competitiveness and market positioning of key commodities.","MethodOfComputation":"Export Value: Sum the reported value of each exported commodity by year and destination country, based on customs declarations.\nExport Quantity: Sum the total physical quantity (in kg/tonnes/litres) of each commodity exported.\nUnit Price: Divide export value by quantity to calculate the price per unit.\n\nFormula: \nTotal Export Value (VUV) = \u2211 Export value by commodity and country\nTotal Export Quantity (kg/tonnes/litres) = \u2211 Export quantity by commodity\nUnit Price = Export Value \u00f7 Export Quantity\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Export Value: Million Vatu (VUV)\nQuantity: Kilograms or tonnes (as applicable)\nUnit Price: Vatu per kilogram/litre\n","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs and Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"values of principle imports to main countries of destination in vatu","unit":"VUV","title":"values of principle imports to main countries of destination"},{"series":"Quantity ","unit":"tonnes kilogram","title":"Quantity of principle imports to main countries destination"},{"series":"Price per unit","unit":"vatu per kilogram/litre","title":"Graph showing price per unit of principle imports to main countries destinations"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Imports Trades in Vanuatu","indicator_number":"import trades","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Trade- Imports\nVanuatu\u2019s total imports rose from 9.7 billion Vatu in 2021 to a peak of 17.1 billion in 2023, before reducing to 11.5 billion in 2024.
