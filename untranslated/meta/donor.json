{"Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cDonor Funds Allocated to Government by Ministry\u201d tracks the total value of donor funding allocated directly to government ministries for a given year. It includes all external assistance channelled through government systems, whether as project-specific grants or general budget support.","Concept":"This indicator is based on the concept of external development financing aligned with national systems. Donor funds are a critical complement to domestic budgets in many developing countries, particularly for achieving development goals. Tracking these allocations helps assess the degree of donor alignment with government plans, the extent of external resource mobilisation, and the effectiveness of aid coordination.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring donor funds allocated to government ministries is essential for understanding the scale and focus of external support. It highlights which sectors receive donor investments and whether those funds are being integrated into national plans and systems. High reliance on donor funding in key sectors may indicate strategic partnerships, but it can also raise issues of sustainability and dependency.","MethodOfComputation":"Aggregate the total value of donor contributions recorded under each ministry for the reference year. Data should reflect actual commitments or disbursements made through the government budget framework, either as stand-alone projects or pooled funding.\n\nFormula: \nDonor Funds Allocated to Ministry (M, year Y) = \u2211 Donor Contributions recorded for Ministry M in year Y\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Millions of Vatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Government Operation Finances by Donor","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"The Republic of Vanuatu Government Finances by Donor","indicator_number":"operation-budget-donor","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Aid is an important source of development financing \u2013 particularly in Low Income or Least\nDeveloped Countries where it accounts for a large share of the national budget, but also in Middle Income countries where it can play a strong catalytic role.\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"donor","goal_number":"donor","indicator_sort_order":"donor"}
