This includes the value of exports and imports specifically facilitated by the preferential trade terms and agreements set forth by the MSG.","Concept":" This indicator tracks the economic value generated through trade activities among MSG member countries, which include Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) of New Caledonia. The MSG Trade Agreement aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among these Melanesian countries by reducing trade barriers, enhancing market access, and fostering regional trade. The trade value represents the financial impact of these economic activities, capturing the total worth of goods and services exchanged under the agreement.","Disaggregation":"Country, Sector & Type of Trade ","Rationale":"Monitoring the MSG Trade Agreement value is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the agreement in fostering regional trade and economic development. A higher trade value indicates that member countries are benefiting from increased market access and trade opportunities, which can contribute to economic growth, job creation, and regional cooperation. Conversely, a lower trade value might suggest barriers to trade or underutilization of the agreement's provisions.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement Value,\" first collect data on the total monetary value of goods and services exported and imported between MSG member countries under the trade agreement. Then, sum the value of all exports and imports facilitated by the agreement. This total represents the MSG Trade Agreement value. For trend analysis, compare the trade values over multiple periods to identify changes in regional trade dynamics.\n\nFormula:\nMSG Trade Agreement Value= Total Value of Exports (MSG) - Total Value of Imports (MSG)\n\n","SDGAlignment":"17.11.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue Department","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Trade by trade agreement (value)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-02"}
