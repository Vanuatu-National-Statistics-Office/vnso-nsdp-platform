This indicator includes exports and imports of goods, providing insights into the country's trade performance and economic integration with global markets.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the performance of Vanuatu\u2019s international trade by assessing both the value (in monetary terms) and the volume (in physical quantities) of merchandise traded. The value of trade refers to the total monetary worth of goods exported and imported, expressed in the national currency. The volume of trade refers to the total quantity of goods traded, measured in tons.","Disaggregation":"Commodity","Rationale":"Monitoring the value and volume of international trade is crucial for understanding the economic health and trade competitiveness of a country. The value of trade helps assess the financial impact of trade activities on the economy, while the volume of trade offers insights into the physical scale and demand for goods.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Value and Volume of International Trade/Merchandise Trade,\" first collect data on the total monetary value of exports of goods for the reporting period from sources such as customs authorities or trade databases. Then, collect data on the physical quantity of goods traded during the same period, measured in metric tons or other relevant units. Aggregate the data for exports to obtain the total trade value and volume.\n\nFormula: \nTotal Trade Value=Total Value of Exports\nTotal Trade Volume=Total Volume of Exports \n","SDGAlignment":"8.a.1\n17.12.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Million & Kilograms in Tonnes","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue Department ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-12","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Value and Volume of National Trade/Merchandise Trade","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"The value of Vanuatu\u2019s merchandise exports fluctuated significantly over the past decade, rising from 3.7 billion Vatu in 2012 to 6.5 billion in 2023.
