This includes the creation of maps that detail forest cover, land use, biodiversity, deforestation rates, reforestation efforts, and other forest-related data.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the development and application of GIS technology to improve the management of forest resources. GIS mapping provides spatial data that is crucial for effective decision-making in forestry management, enabling stakeholders to visualize and analyze various aspects of forest ecosystems. The indicator reflects efforts to integrate advanced technology into forest management practices, ensuring that forest activities are sustainable, transparent, and based on accurate, up-to-date information.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the establishment of GIS mapping relevant to forest management is essential for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of forest conservation and resource utilization efforts. GIS mapping allows for better planning and monitoring of forest activities, such as logging, conservation, reforestation, and habitat protection. It helps forest managers, policymakers, and environmental organizations to make informed decisions, identify areas at risk, plan sustainable harvesting, and track changes in forest cover over time.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Establishment of GIS Mapping Relevant to the Management of Forest Activities,\" first identify and list all GIS mapping projects developed specifically for forest management. Then, verify that these projects include relevant data layers and tools that are actively used or planned for use in managing forest activities. Next, assess the status of these GIS tools to determine whether they are fully developed and operational. Finally, document the progress made in establishing and integrating these GIS tools into forest management practices.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Established GIS Mapping Projects = Sum of All Verified GIS Mapping Projects for Forest Management \n","SDGAlignment":"12.2.1, 15.1.1, 15.1.2, 15.2.1, 15.3.1, 15.4.1 & 15.4.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Forestry","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":true,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Establishment of GIS mapping relevant to the management of forest activities","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"Vanuatu has established a foundational GIS-based forest inventory system to support Indicator ENV 4.2.2. Under the National Forestry Policy, the Department of Forestry is conducting a National Forest Inventory (NFI)\u2014a ten-yearly, ground-based survey across over 1,000 sample plots covering major islands (e.g., Santo, Malekula, Efate) aimed at measuring tree volume, species, and forest condition. The NFI, supported by GIS equipment and open-source tools from the UN-REDD/MRV program, allows precise mapping and monitoring of forest cover and biomass. This integration of spatial data, remote sensing, and forest field measurements ensures that the forestry sector has up-to-date, geospatial information critical for sustainable forest management and policy development.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-02-02"}
