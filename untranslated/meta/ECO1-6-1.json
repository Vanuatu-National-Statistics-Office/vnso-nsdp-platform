These reports typically include evaluations of trade flows, economic benefits, compliance with terms, and the broader socio-economic impacts of the trade agreements.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the systematic review and analysis of trade agreements through formal reports. These reports assess how well trade agreements are functioning, identify challenges or benefits, and provide recommendations for improving or renegotiating terms. The analysis often covers various aspects of the trade agreements, including tariff reductions, market access, trade balances, investment flows, and compliance with environmental, labour, or other standards. The reports serve as tools for policymakers, trade negotiators, and stakeholders to understand the implications of trade agreements and to make informed decisions.","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Monitoring the production of trade agreement analysis reports is crucial for ensuring that trade agreements are effectively contributing to national economic goals. These reports provide valuable insights into whether trade agreements are delivering the expected benefits, such as increased exports, job creation, and economic growth, or if they are causing adverse effects like trade deficits or loss of domestic industries. By systematically analyzing trade agreements, governments can refine their trade policies, address issues in implementation, and enhance the benefits of international trade for the country.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Trade Agreement Analysis Reports\" indicator, first collect data on the number of reports produced within a specific period that analyse the impact and effectiveness of trade agreements in which the country is involved. Ensure that these reports include comprehensive evaluations of trade flows, economic impacts, compliance with terms, and recommendations for improvement. Count the total number of reports produced during the reporting period. If applicable, evaluate how these reports are being used by policymakers and stakeholders to inform decisions on trade policy and negotiations.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Trade Agreement Analysis Reports= Total Number Reports Meeting Criteria\n","SDGAlignment":"10.a.1\n17.10.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department for External Trade, Vanuatu Aid for Trade Unit","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-09","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Trade agreement analysis reports","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-06-01"}
