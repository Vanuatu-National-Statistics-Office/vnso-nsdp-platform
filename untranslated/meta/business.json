{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cNumber of Business Licenses Issued by Industry\u201d measures the total number of business licenses issued by the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue, disaggregated by major industry and year. It reflects formal business registration activity across the economy.","Concept":"The indicator draws on the concept of formalisation of economic activity, which is a critical element of inclusive growth and regulatory governance. A business license is a formal recognition that an entity is permitted to operate within a specific sector under national regulations. Tracking business licenses by industry allows policymakers to monitor trends in entrepreneurship, sector growth, and regulatory compliance.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring business license data provides insights into the scale and composition of registered economic activity. Increases in license issuance may indicate economic dynamism or improved enforcement, while declines may reflect barriers to formalization. Disaggregating the data by sector supports targeted policy interventions, such as reducing registration burdens or promoting priority industries.","MethodOfComputation":"Sum the number of licenses issued per year for each major or minor industry category, based on official licensing records from the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue. Exclude renewals if only new registrations are of interest.\n\nFormula: \nBusiness Licenses Issued by Industry (I, year Y) = \u2211 Number of Licenses Issued for Industry I in year Y\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs and Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Nummber","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"business by major industries","unit":"total count","title":"businesses by major industries"},{"series":"proportion of businesses by major industries","unit":"percentages","title":"proportion of businesses by major industries"},{"series":"businesses by minor industries","unit":"total count","title":"businesses by minor industries"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Number of Business Licenses Issued by Industry","indicator_number":"business license","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Finance- Business License\nThe number of business licenses issued increased gradually from 7,400 in 2015 to over 9,200 by 2019, then dropped sharply to 5,000 in 2021\u2014likely due to pandemic-related disruptions.
