An indigenous language is a language native to a particular region or community, traditionally spoken by the indigenous peoples of that area.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which indigenous languages are passed down as the first language to new generations within a population. The first language learned by an individual plays a crucial role in shaping their cultural identity, cognitive development, and linguistic proficiency. The indicator provides insight into the intergenerational transmission of indigenous languages, which is key to preserving linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that learned an indigenous language as their first language is essential for assessing the vitality of these languages within a community. A higher proportion indicates strong cultural continuity and effective transmission of indigenous languages from one generation to the next. Conversely, a declining proportion may signal language shift, where dominant languages replace indigenous ones as the primary language of communication.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population Whose First Language Learned is Indigenous,\" first collect data on the first language learned by individuals through surveys or census, asking respondents to identify the language they first learned to speak as a child. Identify the number of individuals who report an indigenous language as their first language. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of indigenous first language learners by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\n**Formula**:\nProportion of Indigenous First Language Learners (%) = (Number of Indigenous First Language Learners/ Total Population Surveyed) *100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1 (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-06-23","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"%","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population first language learned indigenous","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-01-02"}
