A fully functional health facility is one that provides the full range of services it is designated to offer, as per the guidelines of the RDP, including staffing, equipment, infrastructure, and the availability of essential medicines and supplies.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the operational status of health facilities in relation to the standards set by the Role Delineation Policy, which defines the roles and responsibilities of different levels of healthcare facilities (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary) within the health system. The Role Delineation Policy ensures that each facility type is equipped and staffed appropriately to deliver specific health services, thereby contributing to a well-coordinated and efficient healthcare system.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of fully functional health facilities according to the Role Delineation Policy is essential for assessing the capacity and readiness of the healthcare system to provide comprehensive and equitable healthcare services. Facilities that meet the RDP standards are better equipped to deliver quality care, manage patient loads, and respond to health emergencies.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Fully Functional Health Facilities (HFs) According to Role Delineation Policy,\" first define the specific criteria for full functionality based on the Role Delineation Policy. Conduct assessments or audits to evaluate whether health facilities meet these criteria. Identify the number of facilities that are fully functional. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of fully functional health facilities by the total number of facilities assessed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Fully Functional Health Facilities (%) = (Number of Fully Functional Health Facilities/Total Number of Health Facilities Assessed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.2, & 3.8.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of fully functional HFs according to Role Delineation Policy","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-01-03"}
