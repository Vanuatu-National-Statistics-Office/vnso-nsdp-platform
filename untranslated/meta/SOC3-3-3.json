This rate captures the risk of death during the first five years of life, a critical period in a child's development.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the overall health and well-being of children under five years old, reflecting the effectiveness of a country\u2019s health system, particularly in areas such as maternal health, neonatal care, immunization, nutrition, and disease prevention. The under-5 mortality rate is a key metric used globally to assess child health and survival.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the under-5 mortality rate is essential for understanding the health status of a population, particularly the most vulnerable age group\u2014infants and young children. A high under-5 mortality rate indicates challenges in healthcare delivery, such as inadequate maternal and child health services, poor nutrition, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Conversely, a declining under-5 mortality rate suggests improvements in these areas.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Under-5 Mortality Rate,\" first collect data on the total number of deaths of children under five years old within a specified period. Then, obtain data on the total number of live births during the same period. Next, divide the number of deaths of children under five by the total number of live births, and multiply the result by 1,000 to express the rate as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births.","SDGAlignment":"3.b.1, 3.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Rate per 1,000 live births","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-04","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"number of deaths per 1000 live births","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Under 5 mortality rate","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years with latest available data","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-03-03"}
