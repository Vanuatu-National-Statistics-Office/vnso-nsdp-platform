This indicator provides insights into the media consumption habits of the population.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the usage of different media platforms by the population for obtaining news. The media outlets considered include traditional forms like newspapers, radio, and television, as well as modern digital platforms such as mobile phones and the internet. Understanding how people access news is important for evaluating the reach and influence of different media types and for ensuring that information dissemination is effective and inclusive across various demographic groups.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that uses various media outlets for news is crucial for assessing the accessibility and effectiveness of information dissemination in society. High usage of diverse media platforms indicates that a wide range of the population is staying informed through various channels, which is essential for an informed citizenry. It also highlights the penetration of digital media and the continued relevance of traditional media. Conversely, low usage of certain media outlets may suggest barriers to access, such as cost, literacy, or infrastructure limitations.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population Utilizing Media Outlets for News Including: Newspapers, Mobile Phones, Radio, Television, and Internet,\" first design and administer a survey that asks respondents about their use of various media outlets to access news. Then, identify and count the number of respondents who report using each media outlet. Divide the number of respondents using each outlet by the total number of respondents, and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population Using Media Outlets (%) = (Number of People Using Any Media Outlet for News/Total Population) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"16.10.1, 16.10.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Total population","unit":"","title":"Total population utilizing media outlets for news including: newspapers, mobile phones, radio, television, and internet"},{"series":"Proportion of population","unit":"","title":"Proportion of population utilizing media outlets for news including: newspapers, mobile phones, radio, television, and internet"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[{"organisation":"VBos 2016 mini census","periodicity":"","earliest_available":"","geographical_coverage":"","url":"","url_text":"","release_date":"","next_release":"","statistical_classification":"","contact":"","other_info":"","logo":""},{"organisation":"VBoS 2020 National Population & Housing Census","periodicity":"","earliest_available":"","geographical_coverage":"","url":"","url_text":"","release_date":"","next_release":"","statistical_classification":"","contact":"","other_info":"","logo":""}],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC6-07-01"}
