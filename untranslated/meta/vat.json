{"Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cValue Added Tax (VAT) Collected by Major Industry\u201d measures the total Value Added Tax (VAT) collected from registered businesses, disaggregated by major industry groups. It captures the contribution of each sector to total VAT revenue collected by the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue.","Concept":"This indicator reflects the concept of domestic revenue mobilisation through indirect taxation, specifically VAT. VAT is a consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production or distribution. As a broad-based tax, it is a major source of government revenue and a key instrument for financing public expenditure. Disaggregating VAT by industry supports analysis of the economic structure, sectoral tax compliance, and the relative productivity of different sectors in contributing to the tax base.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Tracking VAT collected by industry provides valuable insights into the distribution of taxable economic activity across sectors. It helps identify which industries are contributing most to public finances and can signal areas where compliance is strong or where enforcement may need to be strengthened. Trends over time can reveal structural shifts in the economy or the impact of tax policy changes. High VAT collection in certain sectors may indicate robust consumer activity, while low figures in others may reflect informal practices or underreporting.","MethodOfComputation":"Aggregate the total VAT collected for each major industry group, based on reported VAT returns, and recorded transactions from VAT-registered businesses. Include both domestic and import-based VAT where relevant, ensuring values are net of refunds.\n\nFormula: \nVAT Collected by Industry (I, year Y) = \u2211 VAT Revenue from Industry I in year Y\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Millions of Vatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs and Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"value added tax in Vanuatu on goods and services","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Value added tax on goods and services in Vanuatu","indicator_number":"vat","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"VAT is an indirect consumption tax imposed at the rate of 15% on most goods and services supplied in Vanuatu by registered persons in the course of a taxable activity. \n\nIt is also imposed on most goods imported into Vanuatu.
