  In 2021, the estimated total trade value under trade agreements accounted for
  3.4% of Vanuatu’s GDP, down slightly from 3.7% in 2020. Export contributions
  remained steady at 0.8% in both years, while imports declined from 2.9% to
  2.7% of GDP. This suggests a minor contraction in trade flows covered by
  agreements, potentially reflecting broader trade or economic disruptions.
