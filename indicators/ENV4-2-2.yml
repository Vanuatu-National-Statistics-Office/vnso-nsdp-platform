  Vanuatu has established a foundational GIS-based forest inventory system to
  support Indicator ENV 4.2.2. Under the National Forestry Policy, the
  Department of Forestry is conducting a National Forest Inventory (NFI)—a
  ten-yearly, ground-based survey across over 1,000 sample plots covering major
  islands (e.g., Santo, Malekula, Efate) aimed at measuring tree volume,
  species, and forest condition. The NFI, supported by GIS equipment and
  open-source tools from the UN-REDD/MRV program, allows precise mapping and
  monitoring of forest cover and biomass. This integration of spatial data,
  remote sensing, and forest field measurements ensures that the forestry sector
  has up-to-date, geospatial information critical for sustainable forest
  management and policy development.
