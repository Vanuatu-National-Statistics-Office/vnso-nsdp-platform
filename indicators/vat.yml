  Total VAT collections rose from 106 billion Vatu in 2012 to a peak of nearly
  190 billion in 2021, before declining to 152 billion in 2022. Key contributors
  include wholesale and retail trade, construction, and accommodation services,
  which consistently show strong VAT returns. These trends indicate the growing
  role of formal sector activity in domestic revenue mobilization, while lower
  collections in agriculture and informal sectors may suggest persistent
  compliance gaps or structural informality.


  It is also imposed on most goods imported into Vanuatu.  Some supplies are
  specifically exempted from VAT, while others are zero-rated (i.e. treated as
  taxable supplies but at a rate of 0%).
