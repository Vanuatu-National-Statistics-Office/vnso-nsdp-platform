  Vanuatu produces trade agreement analysis reports to support evidence-based
  policymaking and monitor regional trade performance. The Vanuatu Bureau of
  Statistics (VBoS) provides regular monthly trade statistics under the
  Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) framework, reporting import and export
  volumes by partner country and commodity group. VBoS also maintains metadata
  on Vanuatu’s participation in key agreements, including the WTO, PACER Plus,
  PICTA, and the MSG FTA. A notable 2021 peer-reviewed study, using the INFORMAS
  framework, assessed the impact of WTO commitments on food imports,
  highlighting increased ultra-processed food consumption. The Vanuatu Trade
  Policy Framework (2019–2025) and related Cost-Benefit Analyses
  (CBAs)—including those under the SPIRIT Project—have guided negotiations such
  as the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) with the EU. Together,
  these tools offer a robust foundation for aligning trade policy with national
  development goals and regional commitments.
