  Vanuatu’s GDP growth rate fluctuated over the past decade, reaching a high of
  7.5% in 2016 before declining to 2.2% in 2018 and rebounding to 4.6% in 2019.
  The economy contracted sharply in 2020 with an estimated -3.5% growth rate,
  reflecting the combined impact of Cyclone Harold and the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Despite short-term volatility, medium-term growth averaged around 3%—just
  below the 4% target set for 2030.
