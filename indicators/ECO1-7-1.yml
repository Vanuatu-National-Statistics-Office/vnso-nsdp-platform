  Total export values for Vanuatu's major commodities fluctuated between 2012
  and 2021, peaking at 4.7 billion Vatu in 2017 before slightly declining to 4.5
  billion in 2021. Kava emerged as the leading export commodity from 2016
  onward, contributing over 2.4 billion Vatu in both 2020 and 2021. Copra and
  coconut oil showed significant variation, with copra exports falling from a
  high of 1.8 billion Vatu in 2017 to 845 million in 2021. The shifting
  composition of exports indicates rising reliance on high-value crops like
  kava, with declining trends for traditional bulk commodities like copra and
  coconut oil.
