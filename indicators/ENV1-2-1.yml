  The Gudfala Kakae policy in Vanuatu, launched in 2020, focuses on improving
  food and nutrition security by promoting local food production and
  consumption. It aims to ensure that ni-Vanuatu can grow and eat more
  nutritious, locally-sourced food, thus enhancing their health and prosperity.
  The policy aligns with the Vanuatu National Sustainable Development Plan
  (NSDP) and is being implemented through various initiatives, including the
  Farm to Table concept which encourages the use of local food in restaurants
  and school cafeterias.
