  The 2022 National Agriculture Census report was officially launched in 2024,
  providing the most comprehensive and up-to-date data on primary production
  across agriculture, livestock, forestry, fisheries, and biosecurity. As the
  first agriculture census in over a decade, it collected detailed information
  from farming households nationwide, covering land use, crop production,
  livestock holdings, farming practices, and access to services. This data is
  critical for informed decision-making, policy development, and national
  reporting on food security, rural livelihoods, and sustainable resource
  management.
