  The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (CCDRR) Policy Implementation
  Plan provides a clear framework for aligning sectoral programs with national
  climate change (CC) and disaster risk management (DRM) priorities. It outlines
  the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders—across government
  ministries, provincial authorities, civil society, development partners, and
  the private sector—who are actively implementing components of the CCDRR
  policy. This coordinated approach ensures that sectoral plans, projects, and
  legislation are aligned with national climate resilience and disaster risk
  reduction goals, promoting coherence, avoiding duplication, and strengthening
  the overall impact of Vanuatu’s climate and disaster policies.
