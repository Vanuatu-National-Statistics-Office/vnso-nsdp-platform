  Government revenue in Vanuatu rose from 15.8 billion Vatu in 2011 to over 42
  billion in 2020, marking an overall increase of more than 160% over the
  decade. While year-on-year growth fluctuated—spiking at 40% in 2015 and
  falling by 16% in 2016—strong gains in 2017 and 2018 contributed to sustained
  upward momentum. The 4.6% increase in 2020 indicates continued revenue
  resilience despite external challenges. These trends reflect a combination of
  improved collection, policy reforms, and economic growth, supporting progress
  toward the 2030 target of a 30% increase.
