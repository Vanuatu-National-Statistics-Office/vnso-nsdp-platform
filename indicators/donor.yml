  Donor funding allocated through government systems peaked at over 28.5 billion
  Vatu in 2015 but declined sharply to around 15 billion by 2020 before
  partially recovering to 18 billion Vatu in 2024. This fluctuation reflects
  changing donor priorities and possibly the winding down of major projects.
  Ministries of Health, Education, and Climate Change have consistently
  attracted significant donor support, aligning with both national development
  goals and global aid agendas.
