  The Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics launched an AI-driven land use capability
  mapping system in 2025 that uses machine learning and freely available
  open-source satellite imagery (such as Sentinel and Landsat) to automatically
  analyze and classify land cover. This approach was essential for accurately
  identifying key land types—agriculture, forests, grasslands, built-up
  infrastructure, and water bodies—across multiple time periods. By leveraging
  free satellite data and automating the analysis, the system enables
  cost-effective, scalable, and timely assessments to support sustainable land
  use planning and crop suitability mapping.
