  All strategic objectives of the National Strategy for the Development of
  Statistics (NSDS) are currently under implementation. However, it is difficult
  to report them as fully achieved, as the NSDS represents an ongoing process of
  strengthening and coordinating the Vanuatu National Statistics System. This
  continuous effort is also mandated under the Statistics Act, which emphasizes
  the long-term institutional collaboration required to deliver quality
  statistics across sectors.
