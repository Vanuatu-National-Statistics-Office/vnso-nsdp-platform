  The average bank interest rate in Vanuatu has shown a steady decline over the
  past two decades, dropping from 11.6% in 2002 to 8.6% in 2024. This downward
  trend reflects improved monetary conditions and greater financial sector
  stability. The indicator is well below the 2030 policy target of 15%,
  suggesting enhanced affordability and accessibility of financial services.
  Continued monitoring will help ensure that credit remains available while
  supporting broader goals of inclusive economic growth.
