  Vanuatu’s total population is projected to grow from approximately 287,000 in
  2020 to over 604,000 by 2050, more than doubling in three decades. This steady
  growth reflects underlying assumptions of moderate fertility and sustained
  improvements in health and migration management. Disaggregated projections
  show a rising share of youth and working-age population in the near term,
  followed by gradual ageing over time. These demographic trends have major
  implications for infrastructure planning, education systems, labour market
  development, and health services.
