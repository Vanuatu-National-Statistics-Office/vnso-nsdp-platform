  Vanuatu 2030 – The National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) sets the
  nation’s 15-year vision for a Stable, Sustainable, and Prosperous Vanuatu. It
  provides the overarching framework for national priorities and aligns with the
  global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress is monitored through the
  Annual Development Report (ADR), prepared by the Department of Strategic
  Policy, Planning, and Aid Coordination (DSPPAC). The ADR monitors
  implementation across the three NSDP pillars Economy, Society, and
  Environment—through 15 goals, 98 policy objectives, 198 indicators, and 205
  targets. The last ADR was published in 2018.
