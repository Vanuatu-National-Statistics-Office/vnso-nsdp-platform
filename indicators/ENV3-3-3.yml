  Vanuatu has developed a range of multi-hazard and risk maps to support
  Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs) and strengthen disaster preparedness.
  These include national and provincial-level maps produced by the National
  Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and localized risk maps developed by the
  National Advisory Board (NAB), covering hazards such as cyclones, floods,
  earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Over 50 hazard and risk maps have been
  produced for key areas like Port Vila and Luganville. These tools provide an
  evidence-based foundation for estimating disaster impacts and planning
  recovery efforts across multiple hazard types.
