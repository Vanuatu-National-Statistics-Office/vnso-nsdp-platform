  ### Finance- Business License

  The number of business licenses issued increased gradually from 7,400 in 2015
  to over 9,200 by 2019, then dropped sharply to 5,000 in 2021—likely due to
  pandemic-related disruptions. In 2022 and 2023, licensing surged to over
  27,000 and 26,000 respectively, suggesting a significant rebound in formal
  business activity or possible changes in reporting or enforcement. Dominant
  sectors include accommodation, retail trade, and services, reflecting areas of
  economic concentration.
