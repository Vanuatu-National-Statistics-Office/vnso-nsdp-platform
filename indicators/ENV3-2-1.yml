  The VAN-KIRAP Project has played a key role in supporting the establishment of
  multi-hazard early warning systems across Vanuatu. Through this initiative,
  essential infrastructure and protocols have been developed to monitor and
  disseminate warnings related to a range of hazards, including cyclones,
  floods, droughts, and volcanic activity. The project has also supported the
  development of standard operating procedures, community outreach, and
  institutional capacity-building to ensure warnings reach local populations in
  a timely and accessible manner. In addition, maintenance plans and
  sustainability measures are being integrated to ensure the long-term
  functionality and reliability of these systems beyond the life of the project.
