  The Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) has undertaken institutional reforms to
  strengthen the capacity and coordination of its core departments, including
  the National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction
  (NAB) and the Department of Climate Change. A revised organisational structure
  has already been implemented across several MoCC departments, with a
  comprehensive review currently underway to assess effectiveness and identify
  areas for further improvement. The outcome of this review will inform a new
  structure submission aimed at enhancing efficiency, clarifying mandates, and
  ensuring that the Ministry is better equipped to lead climate change
  adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction efforts across Vanuatu.
