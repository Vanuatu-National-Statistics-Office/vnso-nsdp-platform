  ### Education- Enrolment 

  School attendance steadily increased from 87,500 in 2018 to nearly 99,000 in
  2021, with stable figures maintained into 2022. This suggests a sustained
  effort in ensuring access to education, even during periods of broader social
  and economic disruption. Attendance data disaggregated by class and geography
  helps identify dropout risks and regional disparities, particularly in remote
  islands. These trends support planning for teacher allocation, infrastructure
  needs, and targeted interventions in underserved areas.
