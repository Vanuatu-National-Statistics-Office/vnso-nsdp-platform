  The "Total Number of External Audits Undertaken to Establish Compliance with
  Conventions and Standards and Expose Non-Conformity" indicator measures the
  total number of external audits conducted on transportation systems (including
  road, sea, and air transport) to assess their compliance with international
  and national conventions, standards, and regulations. These audits aim to
  identify areas of non-compliance and ensure that transportation systems meet
  required safety, environmental, and operational standards.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of external transport audits is essential for
  maintaining and improving the safety, reliability, and compliance of
  transportation systems. Regular audits help to identify and address
  non-compliance with conventions and standards, which could otherwise lead to
  safety hazards, environmental damage, legal penalties, and a loss of public
  trust. By tracking the number of these audits, transportation authorities,
  policymakers, and regulatory bodies can assess the effectiveness of compliance
  efforts, identify systemic issues, and implement corrective actions.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of External Audits Undertaken to Establish
  Compliance with Conventions and Standards and Expose Non-Conformity," first
  collect data from regulatory bodies and external auditors on the number of
  audits conducted on road, sea, and air transport systems within a specific
  period. Categorize the audits based on the mode of transport and the standards
  assessed, then sum the total number of audits to determine the overall level
  of external auditing activity.


  Formula:

  Total Number of External Transport Audits= Sum of Audits Conducted on Road,
  Sea, and Air Transport Systems
