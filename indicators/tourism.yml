  ### Trade- Tourism

  Visitor arrivals by plane steadily increased from 62,000 in 2005 to a peak of
  121,000 in 2019, before collapsing to zero in 2021 due to COVID-19 border
  closures. A gradual recovery began in 2022, with 59,000 visitors arriving by
  plane in 2024—still just half of pre-pandemic levels. Prior to the pandemic,
  most air arrivals came for holidays, primarily from Australia and New Zealand.
  The data underscores both the resilience and vulnerability of the tourism
  sector, and the importance of rebuilding air connectivity and confidence among
  key source markets.
