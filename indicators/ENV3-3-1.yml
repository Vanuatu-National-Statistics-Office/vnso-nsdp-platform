  Vanuatu has established a two-tier system of support plans to strengthen
  disaster coordination, planning, preparedness, response, and recovery at the
  community level. At the provincial level, each province develops a Provincial
  Disaster and Climate Response Plan (PDCRP) in collaboration with the National
  Disaster Management Office. These plans define roles, responsibilities, and
  coordinated actions across government and non-government actors, and are
  reviewed annually with full updates every five years. At the area council
  level, communities conduct local risk and vulnerability assessments that
  inform tailored disaster preparedness and response plans. Together, these
  provincial and area council plans ensure that disaster risk management is both
  locally relevant and nationally coordinated, enabling communities to better
  prepare for and recover from climate-related and natural hazards.
