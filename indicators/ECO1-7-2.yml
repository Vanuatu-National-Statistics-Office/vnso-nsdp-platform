  The total value for this indicator declined from 14,075 in 2022 to 13,374 in
  2023, reflecting a modest decrease at the national level. Shefa Province
  consistently contributed the largest share, though its value dropped
  significantly from 10,665 in 2022 to 8,383 in 2023. In contrast, Sanma
  Province experienced a notable increase, rising from 1,632 to 2,894 over the
  same period. The shift in contributions between provinces suggests a
  redistribution of economic activity or project investments across regions.
