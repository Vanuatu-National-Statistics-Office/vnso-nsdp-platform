  Vanuatu’s net trade position under the MSG Trade Agreement has remained
  negative from 2020 to 2024, with trade deficits ranging from -987 million to
  -3.4 billion Vatu. The largest deficit occurred in 2023, reflecting a widening
  gap between MSG imports and exports. Despite the agreement’s goal of enhancing
  regional trade benefits, these figures suggest limited export gains or rising
  dependency on MSG imports. Strengthening domestic production and market access
  within MSG partners is key to reversing this trend and achieving long-term
  benefits.
