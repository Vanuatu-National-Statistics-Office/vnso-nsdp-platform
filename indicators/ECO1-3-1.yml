  Vanuatu’s national budget position remained in surplus through most of the
  2010s, peaking at 12.9 billion Vatu in 2018, before falling to 2.8 billion in
  2021. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted fiscal balances, with a
  sharp drop in 2020 and partial recovery in 2021. Despite volatility, the
  government has generally maintained a positive operating balance, reflecting
  prudent fiscal management. However, sustaining surpluses will require careful
  alignment of expenditure and revenue strategies, especially under external
  shocks.
