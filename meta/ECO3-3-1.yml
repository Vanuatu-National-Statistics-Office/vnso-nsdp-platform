  The "Rate of Return to Investments in Rural Infrastructure" indicator measures
  the financial or economic return generated from investments made in rural
  infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, water supply, electricity,
  and communication systems. The rate of return is typically expressed as a
  percentage, representing the net benefits derived from these investments
  relative to their costs.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in rural
  infrastructure by calculating the returns generated from such investments over
  time. Rural infrastructure projects are crucial for enhancing connectivity,
  improving access to essential services, boosting agricultural productivity,
  and fostering economic development in rural areas. The rate of return provides
  insight into the economic viability and impact of these projects, helping to
  determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs and to what extent these
  investments contribute to the overall economic growth of rural communities.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the rate of return to investments in rural infrastructure is
  essential for evaluating the success and sustainability of rural development
  initiatives. A higher rate of return indicates that investments in
  infrastructure are generating significant economic benefits, such as increased
  income, reduced costs, improved productivity, and enhanced quality of life for
  rural populations. Conversely, a lower rate of return may suggest that the
  investments are not yielding the expected benefits, possibly due to
  inefficiencies, inadequate planning, or external factors.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Rate of Return to Investments in Rural Infrastructure," first
  collect data on the total costs of rural infrastructure projects and the
  economic benefits generated by these projects. Calculate the net benefits by
  subtracting the total costs from the total economic benefits. Then, calculate
  the rate of return by dividing the net benefits by the total investment costs
  and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. This percentage
  represents the financial or economic return on investments made in rural
  infrastructure.


  Formula:

  Rate of Return (%) = ((Total Economic Benefits – Total Investment Costs)/Total
  Investment Costs)*100
