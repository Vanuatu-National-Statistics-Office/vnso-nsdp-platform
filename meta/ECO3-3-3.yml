  The "Total Number of Standard Operational Storage and Processing Facilities
  Located in Rural Areas by Province" indicator measures the total count of
  storage and processing facilities that meet standard operational criteria and
  are located in rural areas, disaggregated by province. These facilities are
  essential for storing, preserving, and processing agricultural and other
  products to add value and reduce post-harvest losses.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of infrastructure
  critical to the agricultural and rural economy. Standard operational storage
  and processing facilities include warehouses, cold storage units, grain silos,
  and processing plants that adhere to specified operational standards. These
  facilities help in maintaining the quality of produce, extending its shelf
  life, and adding value through processing before it reaches the market. By
  disaggregating the data by province, the indicator provides insight into
  regional disparities in infrastructure availability and highlights areas
  needing further development.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of standard operational storage and processing
  facilities in rural areas is crucial for understanding the level of
  infrastructure development that supports rural economies, particularly in
  agriculture. Adequate storage and processing facilities are vital for reducing
  post-harvest losses, ensuring food security, and enhancing the profitability
  of rural producers by enabling them to store goods during price fluctuations
  and process raw materials into higher-value products.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Standard Operational Storage and Processing
  Facilities Located in Rural Areas by Province," first collect data on the
  number of storage and processing facilities that meet standard operational
  criteria and are located in rural areas. Then, disaggregate this data by
  province and sum the total number of such facilities in each province.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Facilities in Province X= The Total Standard Operational
  Facilities in Rural Areas within Province X
