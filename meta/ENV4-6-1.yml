  The "Annual Estimated Area (Square Km) of Reforestation and Rehabilitation"
  indicator measures the total area, in square kilometres, that has been
  reforested or rehabilitated within a specific year. Reforestation refers to
  the process of planting trees on land that was previously forested but has
  been cleared or degraded, while rehabilitation involves restoring degraded
  land to a more natural state, often through planting native vegetation or
  other restorative actions.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efforts to restore forest ecosystems and
  rehabilitate degraded lands within a given year. Reforestation and
  rehabilitation are critical components of sustainable land management,
  contributing to biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil
  stabilization, water regulation, and the overall enhancement of ecosystem
  services. The indicator provides insights into the scale and effectiveness of
  restoration activities, helping to assess progress toward environmental
  sustainability goals.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the annual estimated area of reforestation and rehabilitation is
  crucial for evaluating the success of environmental restoration programs and
  policies. Forests play a vital role in mitigating climate change, supporting
  biodiversity, and providing resources and livelihoods for communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Annual Estimated Area (Square km) of Reforestation and
  Rehabilitation," first identify all reforestation and rehabilitation projects
  carried out within the year. Estimate the total area covered by these projects
  by reviewing relevant reports, satellite imagery, and GIS data. Then, sum the
  estimated areas of all identified projects to obtain the total area reforested
  or rehabilitated within the year, expressed in square kilometres.



  Formula:

  Total Area of Reforestation and Rehabilitation (sq km) = Sum of Area Covered
  by Each Reforestation/Rehabilitation Project (sq km)
