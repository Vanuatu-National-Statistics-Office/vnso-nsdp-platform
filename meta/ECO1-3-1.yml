  The "Change in National Budget Position (Deficit/Surplus) (GFS Tables)"
  indicator measures the year-over-year or period-over-period change in a
  country's national budget position, specifically tracking shifts between a
  budget deficit or surplus as reported in the Government Finance Statistics
  (GFS) tables. The budget position is calculated as the difference between
  total government revenues and total government expenditures. Budget Deficit
  occurs when government expenditures exceed revenues. Budget Surplus occurs
  when government revenues exceed expenditures.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the fluctuation in a country's budget position,
  reflecting the balance between government income and spending. A change in the
  budget position indicates whether the government is moving towards a higher
  deficit, reducing its deficit, or moving into or out of a surplus position.
  The GFS tables provide standardized financial data that allow for consistent
  monitoring of the government's fiscal health.
Disaggregation: Revenue Source
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in the national budget position is crucial for assessing
  the government's fiscal discipline and sustainability. A budget deficit can
  indicate the need for borrowing and potential increases in public debt, while
  a surplus may allow for debt reduction, savings, or additional investments.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Change in National Budget Position (Deficit/Surplus) (GFS
  Tables)," first collect data on total government revenues and expenditures for
  the current and previous years from the Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
  tables. Calculate the budget position for each year by subtracting total
  expenditures from total revenues. Then, determine the change in the budget
  position by subtracting the previous year's budget position from the current
  years. Express this change in either absolute terms or as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage Change in Budget Position= (Budget Position (Current Year) – Budget
  Position (Previous Year)/ Budget Position (Previous Year))*100
