Definition: >-
  The "Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities" indicator measures the
  total count of waste disposal facilities that are managed under regulated
  conditions to ensure environmental and public health standards are met. These
  facilities include landfills, incinerators, and other waste management sites
  that operate under government-approved protocols to control the disposal of
  waste materials.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of waste disposal
  facilities that are managed in accordance with environmental regulations and
  public health guidelines. Controlled waste disposal facilities are essential
  for managing solid waste in a manner that minimizes environmental impact,
  reduces pollution, and protects public health. These facilities are typically
  equipped with systems for managing leachate, controlling emissions, and
  monitoring environmental compliance.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of controlled waste disposal facilities is crucial for
  assessing the capacity of a region or country to manage its waste responsibly.
  The presence of a sufficient number of regulated waste disposal sites is
  essential for preventing illegal dumping, reducing environmental degradation,
  and safeguarding public health. A higher number of controlled facilities
  suggests better waste management practices and infrastructure, while a lower
  number may indicate potential gaps in waste management capacity.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities," first collect
  data on all waste disposal facilities within the country or region. Verify
  that each facility operates under controlled conditions, adhering to
  environmental and public health standards. Then, sum the total number of
  facilities that meet these criteria.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities= The Total Controlled
  Waste Disposal Facilities in Vanuatu
