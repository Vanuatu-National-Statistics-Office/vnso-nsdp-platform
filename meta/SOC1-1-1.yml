  The "Proportion of Population Speaking Indigenous Language Daily" indicator
  measures the percentage of the population that uses an indigenous language as
  their primary language of communication on a daily basis. Indigenous languages
  are those that are native to a specific region or community and are
  traditionally spoken by indigenous peoples.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the vitality and daily usage of indigenous languages
  within a population. Indigenous languages are crucial carriers of cultural
  identity, traditional knowledge, and community values. The regular use of
  these languages in daily life indicates their continued relevance and the
  strength of cultural heritage within the community. The indicator provides
  insight into the linguistic diversity of a population and the degree to which
  indigenous languages are maintained and transmitted across generations.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population that speaks an indigenous language
  daily is essential for assessing the health and preservation of these
  languages. Indigenous languages are often at risk of decline or extinction due
  to factors such as globalization, urbanization, and the dominance of majority
  languages.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Proportion of Population Speaking Indigenous Language Daily,"
  first collect data on language use through surveys or census, asking
  respondents about their primary language of communication and the frequency of
  indigenous language use. Identify the number of individuals who report
  speaking an indigenous language daily. Calculate the proportion by dividing
  the number of daily speakers by the total population surveyed, and multiply by
  100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Daily Indigenous Language Speakers (% )= (Number of Daily
  Indigenous Language Speakers/Total Population Surveyed) * 100
