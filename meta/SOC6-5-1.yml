  The "Change in Annual Budget Going to Provinces, Municipalities Towards
  Operations/Programs (Devolution of Funding Authority)" indicator measures the
  year-over-year difference in the amount of budget allocated by the central
  government to provincial and municipal governments specifically for their
  operations and programs. This indicator reflects the extent to which fiscal
  authority and resources are being decentralized from the national level to
  local governments.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the process of fiscal decentralization, where financial
  resources and authority are increasingly transferred from the central
  government to lower levels of government, such as provinces and
  municipalities. Devolution of funding authority allows local governments to
  have greater control over their budgets, enabling them to tailor operations
  and programs to meet the specific needs of their communities. This can enhance
  the efficiency, responsiveness, and accountability of public service delivery
  at the local level.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in annual budget allocations to provinces and
  municipalities is crucial for assessing the progress of fiscal
  decentralization efforts. An increase in budget allocations to local
  governments suggests that there is greater devolution of financial authority,
  which can empower local governments to better address local priorities and
  improve service delivery. Conversely, a decrease or stagnation in budget
  allocations may indicate challenges in the decentralization process or central
  government reluctance to relinquish fiscal control.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Change in Annual Budget Going to Provinces, Municipalities
  Towards Operations/Programs (Devolution of Funding Authority)," first collect
  data on the total budget allocated by the central government to provinces and
  municipalities in both the current and previous years. Then, subtract the
  previous year's budget allocation from the current year's allocation to
  determine the change. If needed, divide this change by the previous year's
  budget allocation and multiply by 100 to express the change as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Change in Budget Allocation=Budget Allocation in Current Year – Budget
  Allocation in Previous Year

  Percentage Change in Budget Allocation (%) = (Change in Budget
  Allocation/Budget Allocation in Previous Year) * 100
