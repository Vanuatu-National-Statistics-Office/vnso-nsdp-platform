  The "Total Estimated Value of MSG Trade Agreement as Proportion of GDP"
  indicator measures the total economic value generated from the Melanesian
  Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement, expressed as a percentage of a
  country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This includes the sum of the value of
  exports, imports, and other economic activities directly attributable to the
  MSG Trade Agreement, relative to the overall size of the economy
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the economic significance of the MSG Trade Agreement by
  assessing its contribution to the national economy in relation to GDP. The
  estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement typically includes the value of
  goods and services traded between member countries, investment flows, and
  other direct economic benefits resulting from the agreement. By expressing
  this value as a proportion of GDP, the indicator provides insight into how
  much the MSG Trade Agreement contributes to the country's economic output.
Disaggregation: None
Rationale: >-
  Rationale and interpretation:

  Monitoring the total estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement as a
  proportion of GDP is crucial for understanding the impact of this regional
  trade agreement on the domestic economy. A higher proportion indicates that
  the MSG Trade Agreement plays a significant role in the economy, contributing
  to economic growth, regional integration, and increased trade and investment
  flows. Conversely, a lower proportion might suggest that the agreement has a
  limited impact or that there are untapped opportunities within the MSG
  framework.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Estimated Value of MSG Trade Agreement as Proportion of
  GDP," first collect data on the total estimated economic value generated from
  the MSG Trade Agreement, including the value of exports. Then, obtain the
  total GDP for the same reporting period. Calculate the proportion by dividing
  the total estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement by the GDP and multiply
  by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of MSG Trade Agreement Value of GDP= ((Total Value of Exports
  (MSG))/GDP)*100
