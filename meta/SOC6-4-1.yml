  The "Proportion of Business Plan (BP) Objectives Met as Reported in Department
  Annual Reviews (ARs)" indicator measures the percentage of objectives outlined
  in a department's Business Plan (BP) that were successfully achieved within a
  given period, as documented in the department's Annual Review (AR). This
  indicator reflects the department's effectiveness in executing its strategic
  goals and objectives.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the performance of departments in achieving their
  planned objectives as set out in their Business Plans. A Business Plan
  typically outlines the strategic goals, specific objectives, and planned
  activities for a department over a certain period. The Annual Review is a
  report that assesses the progress made towards these objectives, providing an
  evaluation of the department's performance.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of Business Plan objectives met is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of departmental operations. A high
  proportion indicates that the department is successful in achieving its goals
  and objectives, which contributes to the overall performance of the
  organization or government entity. Conversely, a low proportion may signal
  challenges in implementation, resource constraints, or other issues that need
  to be addressed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Business Plan (BP) Objectives Met as Reported in
  Department Annual Reviews (ARs)," first identify and list all objectives
  outlined in the department's Business Plan for the reporting period. Then,
  collect data from the Annual Review to determine which objectives were
  reported as met. Divide the number of objectives met by the total number of
  objectives in the Business Plan, and multiply by 100 to express the proportion
  as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Objectives Met (%) = (Number of Objectives Met/Total Number of
  Objectives in Business Plan) * 100
