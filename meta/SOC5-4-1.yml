  The "Annual Number of Patrol Missions Within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)"
  indicator measures the total number of patrol missions conducted by maritime
  security forces, coast guards, or other relevant authorities within a
  country's Exclusive Economic Zone over a one-year period. These patrols are
  typically aimed at monitoring, controlling, and safeguarding the resources and
  activities within the EEZ.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the frequency and extent of surveillance and enforcement
  activities within a country's EEZ, which extends up to 200 nautical miles from
  its coast. The EEZ is a crucial area where a state has special rights over the
  exploration and use of marine resources, including fishing, mining, and energy
  production. Regular patrol missions are essential for ensuring the protection
  of these resources, preventing illegal activities such as unauthorized
  fishing, smuggling, and pollution, and maintaining national security.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the annual number of patrol missions within the EEZ is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness of maritime security and resource management. A
  higher number of patrol missions typically indicates a strong commitment to
  enforcing laws, protecting marine resources, and ensuring the safety of
  maritime activities. Conversely, a lower number may signal potential gaps in
  surveillance, which could lead to illegal exploitation of resources,
  environmental damage, or security threats.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Annual Number of Patrol Missions Within Exclusive Economic
  Zones," first collect data on the total number of patrol missions conducted
  within the EEZ during the specified year from relevant maritime enforcement
  agencies. Then, verify that these patrols occurred within the EEZ and involved
  relevant activities. Finally, count the total number of verified patrol
  missions to determine the indicator value.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Patrol Missions Within EEZ = Sum of All Patrol Missions
  Conducted Within the EEZ in One Year
