Definition: >-
  The "Number of Support Plans Available to Communities for Coordination,
  Planning, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery" indicator measures the total
  count of formally developed and accessible plans that provide guidance and
  resources to communities for managing disaster risks and responding
  effectively to emergencies. These plans cover various aspects of disaster
  management, including coordination, planning, preparedness, response, and
  recovery.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and dissemination of disaster
  management support plans at the community level. Support plans are
  comprehensive documents that outline the roles, responsibilities, strategies,
  and resources needed to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters.
  These plans are crucial for ensuring that communities are equipped with the
  knowledge and tools to manage risks and reduce the impact of disasters. The
  indicator reflects the efforts made by governments, NGOs, and other
  stakeholders to enhance community resilience and disaster readiness.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of support plans available to communities is essential
  for assessing the level of preparedness and resilience at the local level.
  Well-developed support plans provide clear guidance for community leaders,
  emergency responders, and residents, helping them to coordinate efforts,
  allocate resources effectively, and implement timely responses during
  disasters.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Support Plans Available to Communities for
  Coordination, Planning, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery," first identify
  and list all the relevant support plans developed and made available to
  communities. Then, verify that these plans are accessible to the communities
  they are intended to serve. Finally, count the total number of these available
  and accessible support plans.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Support Plans Available= Total of All Verified Support Plans
