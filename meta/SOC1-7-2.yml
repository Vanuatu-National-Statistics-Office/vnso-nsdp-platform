  The "Proportion of Population that Use Traditional Lands for Agriculture,
  Marine, Forestry, and Livestock for Consumption or Customary Purposes"
  indicator measures the percentage of the population that actively utilizes
  traditional lands for activities such as farming, fishing, forestry, and
  livestock rearing. These activities are carried out either for subsistence
  (consumption) or for customary purposes, which may include cultural practices,
  rituals, or community obligations.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which traditional lands are used by
  communities for essential livelihoods and cultural practices. Traditional
  lands are areas that have been historically and culturally significant to
  indigenous and local communities, providing resources for food, shelter, and
  cultural activities. The use of these lands for agriculture, marine
  activities, forestry, and livestock is deeply rooted in the customs and
  traditions of the community, often governed by customary laws and practices.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population that uses traditional lands for
  agriculture, marine, forestry, and livestock activities is crucial for
  understanding the sustainability of traditional livelihoods and the
  preservation of cultural heritage. The continued use of traditional lands for
  these purposes indicates the resilience of cultural practices and the reliance
  of communities on these resources for their well-being.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population that Use Traditional Lands for
  Agriculture, Marine, Forestry, and Livestock for Consumption or Customary
  Purposes," first design a survey to assess whether individuals or households
  engage in these activities on traditional lands. Then, administer the survey
  to a representative sample of the population and analyse the responses to
  determine the number of respondents who use traditional lands for these
  purposes. Next, divide the number of respondents who engage in these
  activities by the total number of survey respondents. Finally, multiply the
  result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population Using Traditional Lands (% )= (Number of Individuals
  Using Traditional Lands for Agriculture, Marine, Forestry, or Livestock
  Activities/Total Population Surveyed) * 100
