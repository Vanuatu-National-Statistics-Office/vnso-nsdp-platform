  The "Number of Declared Water Protection Zones" indicator measures the total
  count of areas officially designated as Water Protection Zones within a
  specific region or country. Water Protection Zones are designated areas where
  specific regulations and protections are implemented to preserve and manage
  water resources, including rivers, lakes, aquifers, and other water bodies.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the establishment of Water Protection Zones, which are
  critical for safeguarding water quality and ensuring the sustainable
  management of water resources. These zones are typically established to
  protect water sources from pollution, over-extraction, and other environmental
  threats. The designation of Water Protection Zones is a key strategy in
  integrated water resource management, aimed at preserving water ecosystems,
  maintaining safe drinking water supplies, and supporting sustainable
  development.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of declared Water Protection Zones is essential for
  assessing the effectiveness of water resource management strategies. The
  establishment of these zones reflects the commitment of governments and
  environmental agencies to protect vital water resources from degradation and
  ensure their availability for current and future generations.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Declared Water Protection Zones," first identify and
  list all areas that have been officially designated as Water Protection Zones
  by relevant authorities. Then, verify that each area has been formally
  declared through official procedures. Finally, count the total number of areas
  that have been officially declared as Water Protection Zones.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Declared Water Protection Zones = Sum of All Officially
  Declared Zones
