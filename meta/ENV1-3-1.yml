  The "Total Annual Volume of Imports of Food and Products Targeted by DARD as
  Those That Can Be Produced Domestically (Including ‘Value-Added Products)"
  indicator measures the total quantity of imported food and related products
  that have been identified by the Department of Agriculture and Rural
  Development (DARD) as items that could be produced within the country. This
  includes both raw food products and value-added products, which have undergone
  some form of processing or enhancement.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the reliance on imports for food and products that could
  potentially be produced domestically. It focuses on identifying opportunities
  for reducing imports by increasing domestic production capabilities, thereby
  promoting food security, supporting local industries, and reducing the trade
  deficit. The inclusion of value-added products emphasizes the importance of
  not only producing raw goods domestically but also enhancing them through
  processing, which adds economic value.
Disaggregation: Import
Rationale: >-
  Reducing dependency on imported food and products that can be produced
  domestically is essential for strengthening food security, enhancing economic
  resilience, and supporting local agricultural and industrial sectors.
  Monitoring the total annual volume of these imports helps policymakers and
  stakeholders understand the scale of reliance on foreign products and identify
  areas where domestic production can be expanded. This indicator supports the
  strategic goals of DARD to promote self-sufficiency, reduce the outflow of
  foreign currency, and create jobs through the development of local value
  chains.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Total Annual Volume and Value of Imports of Food and Products
  Targeted by DARD as Those That Can Be Produced Domestically," first collect
  data on the total annual volume and value of imported food and related
  products. Verify that these imports are within the categories identified by
  DARD as capable of being produced domestically. Then, calculate the total
  annual volume by summing the quantities of these targeted imports, and
  calculate the total annual value by summing the monetary worth of these
  imports.



  Formula:

  *Total Annual Volume= Sum of the quantities of all targeted imported products
  over the year


  *Total Annual Value= Sum of the monetary values of all targeted imported
  products over the year
