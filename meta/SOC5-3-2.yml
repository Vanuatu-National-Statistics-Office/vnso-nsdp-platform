  The "Total Number of National Security Forces per 1,000 Population" indicator
  measures the number of personnel serving in national security forces,
  including the military, police, and other relevant security agencies, relative
  to every 1,000 people in the population. This indicator reflects the density
  of security personnel available to maintain law and order, defend the nation,
  and respond to emergencies.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of national security
  personnel in relation to the population size. The national security forces
  typically include armed forces, police, and other law enforcement agencies
  responsible for maintaining internal security, enforcing the law, and
  protecting the country from external threats. The indicator helps in
  understanding how well a country is staffed in terms of security personnel
  relative to its population, which can influence the overall effectiveness of
  security operations and public safety.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of national security forces per 1,000 population is
  crucial for assessing a country's capacity to ensure security and public
  order. A higher ratio of security personnel may indicate a robust security
  presence, which can deter crime and enhance the ability to respond to security
  threats. Conversely, a lower ratio might signal potential vulnerabilities in
  maintaining law and order, especially in areas with large or growing
  populations.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of National Security Forces per 1,000
  Population," first collect data on the total number of personnel in the
  national security forces. Then, obtain the total population size for the same
  period. Next, divide the number of security personnel by the total population
  and multiply the result by 1,000 to express the number of security personnel
  per 1,000 population.


  Formula:

  Security Forces per 1,000 Population = (Total Number of National Security
  Forces/Total Population) * 1,000
