  The "Percentage of Students Meeting Literacy and Numeracy Standards" indicator
  measures the proportion of students who achieve the expected proficiency
  levels in literacy (reading and writing) and numeracy (mathematics) according
  to established national or regional educational standards. This indicator
  reflects the effectiveness of the education system in ensuring that students
  acquire essential skills in these fundamental areas.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the academic performance of students in literacy and
  numeracy, which are critical foundational skills for further learning and
  everyday life. Literacy and numeracy standards are typically defined by
  educational authorities and represent the minimum levels of competence that
  students are expected to achieve at specific grade levels. The indicator
  provides insights into the overall quality of education and highlights areas
  where additional support or interventions may be needed to improve student
  outcomes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of students meeting literacy and numeracy standards
  is essential for assessing the effectiveness of educational programs and
  teaching methods. High literacy and numeracy rates indicate that students are
  well-prepared to succeed academically and in life, while low rates may signal
  gaps in instruction, resource allocation, or student support.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Students Meeting Literacy and Numeracy
  Standards," first establish the specific literacy and numeracy benchmarks that
  students are expected to meet. Administer standardized assessments to evaluate
  students' proficiency in these areas. Identify the number of students who
  achieve or exceed the established benchmarks. Calculate the proportion by
  dividing the number of students meeting the standards by the total number of
  students assessed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Students Meeting Literacy and Numeracy Standards (%) = (Number
  of Students Meeting the Standards/Total Number of Students Assessed) * 100
