Definition: >-
  The "Total Number of Mini-Grid Renewable Energy Systems in Rural Communities
  by Province" indicator measures the total count of mini-grid renewable energy
  systems installed and operational in rural communities within each province of
  a country. A mini-grid is a localized power network that typically uses
  renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro, to generate and
  distribute electricity to a small, defined area, often in remote or off-grid
  locations.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the deployment and distribution of mini-grid renewable
  energy systems across rural communities in different provinces. Mini-grids are
  critical for providing electricity to areas not served by the main power grid,
  enhancing energy access, and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
  The indicator helps to assess the progress in rural electrification and the
  spread of sustainable energy technologies in underserved areas.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of mini-grid renewable energy systems in rural
  communities is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of rural
  electrification programs and the promotion of renewable energy. The presence
  of mini-grids indicates an improvement in energy access for rural populations,
  contributing to economic development, improved quality of life, and reduced
  reliance on fossil fuels. By breaking down the data by province, policymakers
  and energy planners can identify regions with greater or lesser progress,
  enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation to areas with the
  greatest need.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Mini-Grid Renewable Energy Systems in Rural
  Communities by Province," first collect data on the number of mini-grid
  systems installed and operational in rural communities from relevant energy
  authorities or providers. Then, categorize the data by province, and aggregate
  the total number of mini-grid systems for each province.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Mini-Grid Systems in Province X = Total Mini-Grid Systems in
  Rural Communities within Province X
