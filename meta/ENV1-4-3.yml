  The "Establishment of Land Use Capability Mapping Systems to Determine Which
  Crops and Farming Systems Are Best Suited to Different Areas" indicator
  measures the development and implementation of mapping systems designed to
  assess land use capabilities. These systems analyze soil types, topography,
  climate, and other environmental factors to identify the most suitable crops
  and farming systems for different regions within a country or area.
Concept: >-
  This indicator focuses on the establishment of tools and methodologies that
  allow for the systematic assessment of land's agricultural potential. Land use
  capability mapping systems are essential for optimizing agricultural
  productivity by ensuring that land resources are used in a manner that
  maximizes crop yields and sustainability. These systems help in matching
  specific crops and farming practices to the most appropriate areas based on
  environmental conditions and land characteristics.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the establishment of land use capability mapping systems is crucial
  for promoting sustainable agriculture and efficient land use management. By
  aligning agricultural activities with the land's natural capabilities, these
  systems help to increase productivity, reduce environmental degradation, and
  promote the efficient use of resources. Monitoring this indicator helps assess
  the progress of efforts to enhance agricultural planning and sustainability
  through science-based land management practices.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Method of computation:

  To assess the "Establishment of Land Use Capability Mapping Systems to
  Determine Which Crops and Farming Systems Are Best Suited to Different Areas,"
  first determine whether the mapping systems have been fully developed,
  including the analysis of environmental and soil factors. Then, verify that
  these systems are operational and being used to guide agricultural planning
  and decision-making. If the systems meet both criteria—development and
  operational status—they are categorized as "established and operational."


  **Formula:**

  This indicator is typically qualitative rather than quantitative, and it does
  not require a mathematical formula. Instead, it involves a checklist or
  categorical assessment based on the following criteria: mapping system
  development, implementation, and use
