  The "Change in Total Number of Individuals Participating in Seasonal Work
  Programmes" indicator measures the year-over-year percentage change in the
  total number of individuals who participate in seasonal work programs. These
  programs typically involve temporary employment opportunities in sectors such
  as agriculture, tourism, or construction, where labour demand fluctuates
  according to the season.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the growth or decline in participation in seasonal work
  programs, which are designed to meet short-term labour needs in specific
  industries while providing employment opportunities for workers. Seasonal work
  programs often involve both domestic and international placements and can be
  critical for addressing labour shortages in certain periods. The indicator
  provides insight into the demand for seasonal labour, the effectiveness of
  these programs in providing employment, and the economic conditions affecting
  labour mobility.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in the total number of individuals participating in
  seasonal work programs is essential for understanding trends in labour market
  flexibility and the role of these programs in supporting employment. An
  increase in participation may indicate rising demand for seasonal labour,
  successful program implementation, or economic conditions that encourage
  workers to seek temporary employment. Conversely, a decrease may suggest
  challenges in program accessibility, changes in labour demand, or economic
  improvements that reduce the need for temporary work.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Change in Total Number of Individuals Participating in
  Seasonal Work Program's," first collect data on the total number of
  participants in the current and previous years. Calculate the change by
  subtracting the previous year’s total from the current year’s total. Then,
  divide the difference by the previous year’s total and multiply by 100 to
  express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Change in Participation (%) = ((Total Participants in Current Year – Total
  Participants in Previous Year)/Total Participants in Previous Year) * 100
