Definition: >-
  The "GDP Growth Rate (Annual/Trends)" indicator measures the annual percentage
  change in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is the total monetary
  value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a
  specific period, usually calculated annually. This indicator reflects the
  overall economic performance and health of an economy by showing how much the
  economy has grown or contracted compared to the previous year.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the growth of a country's economy over time, providing
  insights into the trends and patterns of economic expansion or contraction.
  The GDP growth rate is a key measure of economic performance, indicating how
  well an economy is doing in terms of increasing production, income, and
  wealth. It also reflects the effectiveness of economic policies and the impact
  of external factors such as global economic conditions, trade, and investment.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the GDP growth rate is crucial for understanding the overall
  trajectory of an economy. A positive growth rate indicates that the economy is
  expanding, which generally leads to higher employment, increased income, and
  improved living standards. Conversely, a negative growth rate suggests
  economic contraction, which can lead to higher unemployment, reduced income,
  and potential economic challenges.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "GDP Growth Rate (Annual/Trends)," first collect data on the
  GDP for the current year and the previous year. Then, calculate the growth
  rate by subtracting the previous year's GDP from the current year's GDP,
  dividing the result by the previous year's GDP, and multiplying by 100 to
  express the growth rate as a percentage. For trend analysis, calculate the GDP
  growth rate for multiple years to observe patterns of economic growth or
  contraction over time.


  Formula: 

  GDP Growth Rate= (GDP (Current Year) – GDP (Previous Year)/GDP (Previous
  Year))*100
