Definition: >-
  The indicator “Number of Business Licenses Issued by Industry” measures the
  total number of business licenses issued by the Department of Customs and
  Inland Revenue, disaggregated by major industry and year. It reflects formal
  business registration activity across the economy.
Concept: >-
  The indicator draws on the concept of formalisation of economic activity,
  which is a critical element of inclusive growth and regulatory governance. A
  business license is a formal recognition that an entity is permitted to
  operate within a specific sector under national regulations. Tracking business
  licenses by industry allows policymakers to monitor trends in
  entrepreneurship, sector growth, and regulatory compliance.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring business license data provides insights into the scale and
  composition of registered economic activity. Increases in license issuance may
  indicate economic dynamism or improved enforcement, while declines may reflect
  barriers to formalization. Disaggregating the data by sector supports targeted
  policy interventions, such as reducing registration burdens or promoting
  priority industries.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Sum the number of licenses issued per year for each major or minor industry
  category, based on official licensing records from the Department of Customs
  and Inland Revenue. Exclude renewals if only new registrations are of
  interest.


  Formula: 

  Business Licenses Issued by Industry (I, year Y) = ∑ Number of Licenses Issued
  for Industry I in year Y
