Definition: >-
  The "Number of Reported Cases of Violence Against Women, Children, and
  Vulnerable People" indicator measures the total count of officially reported
  incidents of violence against women, children, and other vulnerable groups
  within a specified period, typically one year. This includes physical, sexual,
  emotional, and psychological abuse, as well as neglect and exploitation.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of violence against women, children, and
  vulnerable people, including those who may be at higher risk due to factors
  such as age, disability, socioeconomic status, or marginalization. Vulnerable
  people can include elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and
  marginalized groups. The indicator reflects the extent to which violence is
  recognized and reported within a society and serves as a measure of the
  effectiveness of law enforcement, social services, and public awareness
  initiatives in addressing and preventing violence.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of reported cases of violence against women, children,
  and vulnerable people is essential for understanding the scope and scale of
  this critical social issue. High numbers of reported cases may indicate a
  significant problem with violence within a community or society, highlighting
  the need for stronger protective measures, support services, and prevention
  strategies. Conversely, low reporting rates could indicate underreporting due
  to stigma, fear, lack of awareness, or inadequate access to reporting
  mechanisms.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Reported Cases of Violence Against Women, Children,
  and Vulnerable People," first collect data on the total number of reported
  cases from police reports. Ensure that the data is accurately categorized by
  type of violence and by the affected group. Next, sum the total number of
  reported cases within the specified period, taking care to avoid
  double-counting. The final count represents the total number of reported
  incidents of violence against women, children, and vulnerable people.


  Formula:

  Number of Reported Cases of Violence = Sum of All Cases of Violence Reported
  Against Women, Children, and Vulnerable People
