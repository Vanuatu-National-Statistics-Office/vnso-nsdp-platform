Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Producers Across the Productive Sector That Have Undergone
  Agro-Met Training" indicator measures the percentage of producers (farmers,
  fishers, foresters, etc.) within the productive sector who have received
  training in agricultural meteorology (Agro-Met). Agro-Met training equips
  producers with the knowledge and skills to use weather and climate information
  to enhance their decision-making, optimize production, and reduce risks
  related to climate variability.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the reach and impact of training programs focused on
  agricultural meteorology within the productive sector. Agro-Met training is
  essential for helping producers understand and respond to weather patterns,
  climate forecasts, and other meteorological data that can influence
  agricultural productivity.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of producers who have undergone Agro-Met training is
  essential for understanding the extent to which the agricultural sector is
  equipped to handle climate variability and change. Agro-Met training is a key
  component of climate-smart agriculture, as it empowers producers to make
  data-driven decisions that can improve crop yields, reduce losses, and enhance
  food security. A higher proportion of trained producers indicates greater
  preparedness and resilience in the face of changing weather patterns, which is
  crucial for sustainable agricultural development.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Producers Across the Productive Sector That Have
  Undergone Agro-Met Training," first collect data on the number of producers
  who have completed Agro-Met training. Then, obtain the total number of
  producers across the productive sector. Calculate the proportion by dividing
  the number of trained producers by the total number of producers, and multiply
  by 100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula

  Proportion of Trained Producers (%) = (Number of Producers Who Have Undergone
  Agro-Met Training/Total Number of Producers Across the Productive Sector) *
  100
