  The "Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Safe Drinking Water"
  indicator measures the percentage of the population that has consistent and
  reliable access to water that meets safety standards for drinking. Safe
  drinking water is water that is free from contaminants and pathogens that
  could harm human health.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which the population can access safe
  drinking water on a reliable basis. Reliable access refers to the consistent
  availability of safe water for daily needs without significant interruptions.
  This indicator is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of water supply
  systems, public health infrastructure, and water management policies. It
  reflects progress toward ensuring that all individuals have access to one of
  the most basic and essential human needs: clean drinking water.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with reliable access to safe
  drinking water is essential for public health, social well-being, and
  sustainable development. Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human
  right and a critical component of public health, as it prevents waterborne
  diseases and promotes overall health and well-being. Ensuring that a high
  proportion of the population has reliable access to safe drinking water is a
  key goal of many national and international development frameworks.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Safe Drinking
  Water," first collect data through surveys or censuses to determine the number
  of households or individuals with consistent and reliable access to safe
  drinking water. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing this number by the
  total population or number of households surveyed, and multiply by 100 to
  express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Safe Drinking Water= (Number
  of Households with Reliable Access/Total Population)*100
