  The "Diphtheria Tetanus Toxoid and Pertussis (DTP3) Immunization Coverage
  Among 1-Year-Olds (%)" indicator measures the percentage of children aged 12
  to 23 months who have received three doses of the DTP vaccine. This vaccine
  protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) and is a
  critical component of childhood immunization programs.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the coverage of the DTP3 vaccine, which is essential for
  preventing the spread of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis—three highly
  contagious and potentially deadly diseases. The DTP3 immunization is typically
  administered as part of a routine childhood vaccination schedule. High
  coverage rates indicate effective immunization programs, contributing to herd
  immunity and the reduction of disease outbreaks.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring DTP3 immunization coverage among 1-year-olds is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness of national immunization programs. High coverage
  rates are associated with lower incidences of diphtheria, tetanus, and
  pertussis, leading to improved public health outcomes. Conversely, low
  coverage rates may signal gaps in healthcare access, vaccine availability, or
  public health education.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoid, and Pertussis (DTP3) Immunization
  Coverage Among 1-Year-Olds (%)," first collect data on the number of children
  who received the third dose of the DTP vaccine by their first birthday. Then,
  obtain the total number of children who turned one year old during the
  reporting period. Calculate the coverage rate by dividing the number of
  children who received DTP3 by the total number of 1-year-olds, and multiply by
  100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  DTP3 Immunization Coverage (%) = (Number of 1 Year Olds Receiving DTP3/Total
  Number of 1 Year Olds) * 100
