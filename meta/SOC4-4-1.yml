Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of the Activities of the National Human Rights Commission
  (NHRC) Implemented" indicator measures the percentage of planned activities
  and initiatives of the NHRC that have been successfully executed within a
  specified time frame. These activities may include investigations, public
  awareness campaigns, policy recommendations, and other initiatives aimed at
  promoting and protecting human rights.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness and operational efficiency of the NHRC
  in carrying out its mandate to uphold and protect human rights. The activities
  of the NHRC are typically outlined in an annual or strategic plan and are
  essential for addressing human rights violations, raising awareness, and
  influencing policy. The proportion of activities implemented serves as a
  measure of the NHRC’s capacity to achieve its objectives and fulfil its
  responsibilities.
Disaggregation: 'Type of activity (advocacy, training, investigations)'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of NHRC activities that are implemented is crucial
  for assessing the commission’s effectiveness in promoting and protecting human
  rights. A high proportion indicates that the NHRC is effectively executing its
  planned initiatives, which contributes to stronger human rights protections
  and greater public confidence in the institution. Conversely, a low proportion
  may suggest challenges such as resource constraints, lack of capacity, or
  other barriers to implementation.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Proportion of the Activities of the National Human Rights
  Commission (NHRC) Implemented," first identify and list all planned activities
  of the NHRC for the specified time frame. Then, collect data on how many of
  these activities have been fully or partially implemented. Next, divide the
  number of implemented activities by the total number of planned activities.
  Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of implemented
  activities as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of NHRC Activities Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented
  Activities/Total Number of Planned Activities) * 100
