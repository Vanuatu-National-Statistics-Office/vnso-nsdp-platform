  The "Current Accounts Balance Change" indicator measures the year-over-year or
  period-over-period change in a country’s current account balance, which is a
  component of the balance of payments. The current account balance reflects the
  difference between a country’s savings and its investment, and it includes the
  trade balance (exports minus imports of goods and services), net income from
  abroad, and net current transfers (such as remittances).
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the fluctuations in the current account balance, which
  is a critical measure of a country’s economic transactions with the rest of
  the world. A positive current account balance (surplus) indicates that a
  country is a net lender to the rest of the world, while a negative balance
  (deficit) suggests that it is a net borrower. The change in the current
  account balance over time provides insights into the dynamics of international
  trade, investment income, and transfers, and helps assess the sustainability
  of a country’s external position.
Disaggregation: None
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in the current account balance is essential for
  understanding a country’s economic health and its ability to engage in
  international trade and financial activities. A significant improvement in the
  current account balance might indicate increased competitiveness, higher
  savings rates, or favorable terms of trade, while a worsening balance could
  signal economic vulnerabilities, such as excessive dependence on foreign
  capital or declining exports.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Current Accounts Balance Change," first collect data on the
  country’s current account balance for the current period and the previous
  period. Then, calculate the change by subtracting the previous period’s
  balance from the current period’s balance. Express this change in absolute
  terms or as a percentage by dividing the change by the previous period’s
  balance and multiplying by 100. This calculation provides insights into how
  the country’s external economic position has evolved over time.


  Formula:

  Percentage Change in Current account Balance= (Current Account Balance
  (Current Year) – Current Account Balance (Previous Year)/ Current Account
  Balance (Previous Year))*100
