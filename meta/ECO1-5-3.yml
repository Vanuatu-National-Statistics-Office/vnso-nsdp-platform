Definition: >-
  The "Balance of Trade by Major Partner Countries" indicator measures the
  difference between the value of a country's exports and imports with its major
  trading partner countries over a specific period, usually annually or
  quarterly. This balance indicates whether the country has a trade surplus
  (exports exceed imports) or a trade deficit (imports exceed exports) with each
  of its key trading partners.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the trade relationships between a country and its major
  trading partners by calculating the balance of trade for each partner. The
  balance of trade is a critical component of a country’s current account and
  reflects the competitiveness of its goods and services in international
  markets. By focusing on major trading partners, this indicator provides
  insights into the bilateral trade dynamics that are most significant to the
  country’s economy.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the balance of trade by major partner countries is crucial for
  understanding the structure of a country's external trade and its economic
  relationships with key international markets. A trade surplus with a major
  partner may indicate a strong competitive position in that market, while a
  trade deficit could suggest reliance on imports or challenges in export
  performance.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Balance of Trade by Major Partner Countries," first identify
  the country’s major trading partners based on trade volume and value. Then,
  collect data on the total value of exports to and imports from each of these
  partners for the specified period. Calculate the trade balance for each
  partner by subtracting the value of imports from the value of exports. A
  positive balance indicates a trade surplus, while a negative balance indicates
  a trade deficit.


  Formula:

  Trade Balance with Country X= Value of Exports to Country X – Value of Imports
  from Country X
