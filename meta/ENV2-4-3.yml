  The "Proportion of Revised National Waste Management Strategy and Action Plan
  Implemented" indicator measures the percentage of the revised National Waste
  Management Strategy and Action Plan that has been successfully put into
  action. This indicator reflects the extent to which the planned initiatives,
  policies, and actions outlined in the strategy have been carried out within a
  specified timeframe.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the progress of implementing a revised national strategy
  and action plan focused on waste management. A waste management strategy
  typically includes goals, policies, and specific actions aimed at improving
  waste collection, processing, recycling, and disposal practices. The revision
  of such a strategy often incorporates updated goals, new technologies,
  regulatory changes, and lessons learned from previous efforts. By measuring
  the proportion of the plan that has been implemented, this indicator provides
  insights into the effectiveness of waste management governance and the
  country's commitment to sustainable waste management practices.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the implementation of the revised National Waste Management
  Strategy and Action Plan is crucial for ensuring that waste management goals
  are being met and that the country is on track to achieve its waste reduction,
  recycling, and environmental protection targets. Effective implementation is
  key to reducing environmental pollution, conserving resources, and improving
  public health.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Revised National Waste Management Strategy and
  Action Plan Implemented," first identify and list all the components,
  initiatives, or actions outlined in the revised strategy and action plan.
  Then, assess the implementation status of each component to determine whether
  it has been fully, partially, or not implemented. Next, divide the number of
  fully implemented actions by the total number of actions outlined in the plan.
  Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of the strategy
  and action plan that has been implemented as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Strategy Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented
  Components/Total Number of Components in the Strategy) * 100
