Definition: >-
  The indicator “Enrolment in Vocational Training Programmes” measures the total
  number of individuals enrolled in accredited vocational training programmes
  during a given year. It includes enrolments across different qualification
  levels (e.g., Certificate, Diploma, Bachelor) and is disaggregated by island
  and field of study or course.
Concept: >-
  Vocational training refers to education that prepares individuals for specific
  trades, crafts, and careers at various levels. It includes both technical and
  non-technical fields and is commonly delivered by Technical and Vocational
  Education and Training (TVET) institutions. "Enrolment" refers to the official
  registration of students in these programmes during the reference year.
  Disaggregation by course and island provides insights into geographic and
  sectoral demand for skills development across Vanuatu.

Rationale: >-
  This indicator helps assess the accessibility and uptake of vocational
  education, which is a key driver for employment, economic development, and
  lifelong learning. It also informs policies related to workforce development,
  education planning, and decentralization of training services. High or growing
  enrolment figures in specific fields can indicate emerging labour market needs
  or successful training outreach efforts.
MethodOfComputation: >
  The indicator is calculated by aggregating administrative data from TVET
  institutions and education authorities. Enrolment numbers are summed for each
  course and island for the specified year. The data includes both new and
  continuing students.


  Formula: 

  None required, the indicator is a direct count of children attending school.
