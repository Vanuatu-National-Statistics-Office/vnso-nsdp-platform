Definition: >-
  The "Subjective Well-being Indicator" measures an individual's self-reported
  assessment of their overall well-being, happiness, or life satisfaction. It
  captures how people perceive the quality of their lives based on their own
  experiences, emotions, and expectations.
Concept: >-
  Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to how people experience and evaluate their
  lives and specific domains and activities within them. Unlike objective
  measures of well-being (such as income, health status, or employment),
  subjective well-being focuses on individuals' personal perceptions and
  feelings. It typically encompasses several dimensions, including life
  satisfaction (cognitive evaluations of life), emotional well-being (presence
  of positive emotions and absence of negative emotions), and a sense of purpose
  or meaning in life.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring subjective well-being is essential for understanding the broader
  picture of human welfare beyond material and economic conditions. High levels
  of subjective well-being are associated with better health outcomes,
  productivity, and social cohesion. By capturing how people feel about their
  lives, this indicator provides valuable insights into the population's mental
  and emotional health, the effectiveness of social policies, and the overall
  quality of life.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Subjective Well-Being Indicator," collect data through surveys
  where respondents rate their life satisfaction and emotional well-being on a
  numerical scale. Calculate the average subjective well-being score by summing
  the individual well-being scores and dividing by the total number of
  respondents. The average score provides a measure of the population's
  perceived well-being, offering insights into mental health, happiness, and
  life satisfaction.


  Formula:

  Average Subjective Well-Being Score = (Sum of All Individual Well-Being
  Scores/Total Number of Respondents)
