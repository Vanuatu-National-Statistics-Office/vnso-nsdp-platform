Definition: >-
  The indicator “Visitor Arrivals by Mode of Transport, Purpose of Visit, and
  Country of Residence” measures the total number of visitors arriving in the
  country, disaggregated by mode of transport (e.g. cruise, plane), purpose of
  visit (e.g. holiday, business, visiting friends), and country of usual
  residence. It provides a comprehensive picture of tourism inflows and visitor
  characteristics.
Concept: >-
  Tourism arrivals are a key metric for economic development, service sector
  performance, and foreign exchange earnings, especially in Small Island
  Developing States (SIDS). Disaggregating arrivals by mode of entry helps
  assess infrastructure needs (airports vs. ports), while purpose of visit
  offers insight into the structure of demand (leisure, business, family).
  Country of residence allows analysis of target markets, seasonality, and
  geopolitical trends.

Rationale: >-
  Tourism is a vital sector for employment, economic diversification, and
  cultural exchange. Tracking visitor arrivals supports planning and investment
  in tourism infrastructure, services, and marketing. Growth in total arrivals
  may reflect improved connectivity, promotion, or global travel conditions.
  Changes in purpose or origin may suggest shifts in demand, international
  relations, or niche market opportunities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Total Visitor Arrivals: Sum of all arrivals recorded at points of entry,
  regardless of purpose or origin.

  Mode of Transport: Count of arrivals recorded as entering by cruise ship,
  plane (residents and visitors separately).

  Purpose of Visit: Total number of arrivals classified under each purpose
  category.

  Country of Residence: Total number of visitors whose usual country of
  residence is reported.


  Formula: 

  Total Arrivals (per year) = Σ (all visitor entries at all borders)

  Arrivals by Mode = Σ (entries by cruise, plane – residents, plane – visitors)

  Arrivals by Purpose = Σ (holiday + business + visiting friends + other)

  Arrivals by Country = Σ (visitors from each reported country of residence)
