  The "Indicators of Women’s Empowerment" encompass a set of metrics that
  collectively measure the extent to which women have control over their lives,
  the ability to make decisions, and access to opportunities across various
  domains, including economic, political, social, and personal spheres. These
  indicators reflect women's autonomy, participation, and influence in different
  aspects of society.
Concept: >-
  Women’s empowerment is a multidimensional concept that includes economic
  independence, political participation, educational attainment, health, social
  status, and personal autonomy. Indicators of women’s empowerment aim to
  capture these dimensions to assess how empowered women are within a specific
  context. Common indicators include women's participation in the workforce,
  access to education, representation in political bodies, control over
  resources, freedom from violence, and participation in decision-making
  processes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring indicators of women’s empowerment is crucial for assessing progress
  toward gender equality and understanding the barriers that women face in
  achieving full empowerment. These indicators provide insight into how well
  societies are supporting women in gaining the skills, opportunities, and
  autonomy needed to make decisions that affect their lives.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Indicators of Women’s Empowerment," first select a set of
  specific indicators representing various dimensions of empowerment, such as
  economic participation, education, political leadership, health, and
  decision-making authority. Collect data on each of these indicators from
  relevant sources, such as national surveys, census data, and administrative
  records. Calculate and aggregate the individual indicator values to assess the
  overall level of women’s empowerment, and track trends over time to measure
  progress. This composite assessment provides insights into how well women are
  being empowered in different areas of life.


  Formula:

  Women’s Labour Force Participation Rate (%) = (Number of Women in the Labour
  Force/Total Number of Women of Working Age) * 100


  Proportion of Women in Leadership (%) = (Number of Women in Leadership
