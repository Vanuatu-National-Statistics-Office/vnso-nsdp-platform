Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Improved Sanitation
  Facilities" indicator measures the percentage of the population that has
  consistent and reliable access to sanitation facilities that meet basic health
  and safety standards. Improved sanitation facilities include flush toilets,
  piped sewer systems, septic tanks, ventilated improved pit latrines, and other
  safe and hygienic means of disposing of human waste.
Concept: >-
  The concept behind this indicator is to assess the progress and effectiveness
  of efforts to provide adequate sanitation services to the population. It
  considers factors such as the availability of improved sanitation facilities,
  their functionality, accessibility, and the practices and behaviors
  surrounding sanitation and hygiene.


  The significance of this indicator lies in its contribution to public health,
  hygiene promotion, and human well-being. Access to improved sanitation
  facilities plays a vital role in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases,
  reducing exposure to health risks, and maintaining a clean and healthy
  environment.
Disaggregation: Region & Time Period
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with reliable access to improved
  sanitation facilities is crucial for public health, environmental
  sustainability, and social well-being. Access to improved sanitation is a key
  factor in preventing the spread of waterborne and other communicable diseases,
  improving overall health outcomes, and enhancing the quality of life.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Improved
  Sanitation Facilities," first collect data through surveys or censuses to
  determine the number of households or individuals with consistent and reliable
  access to improved sanitation facilities. Then, calculate the proportion by
  dividing this number by the total population or number of households surveyed,
  and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.
