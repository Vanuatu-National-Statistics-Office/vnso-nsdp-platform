  The "Percentage of Schools Demonstrating Effective Implementation and
  Management of School Grants" indicator measures the proportion of schools that
  successfully implement and manage school grants according to established
  guidelines and best practices. Effective implementation and management include
  appropriate allocation, utilization, reporting, and monitoring of grant funds
  to support educational activities and improve school performance.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the ability of schools to manage financial resources
  provided through grants efficiently and transparently. School grants are often
  allocated to support specific educational goals, such as improving
  infrastructure, acquiring teaching materials, and enhancing student learning
  outcomes. Effective management of these grants is crucial to ensure that funds
  are used appropriately and achieve the intended impact.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of schools demonstrating effective implementation
  and management of school grants is essential for assessing the overall
  accountability and financial management capacity within the education sector.
  Proper use of school grants is key to improving educational quality and
  ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most needed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Schools Demonstrating Effective Implementation
  and Management of School Grants," first establish specific criteria for
  effective grant management. Conduct audits or evaluations to identify which
  schools meet these criteria. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number
  of schools that demonstrate effective grant management by the total number of
  schools that received grants, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Schools Demonstrating Effective Grant Management (%) = (Number
  of Schools Meeting Grant Management Criteria/Total Number of Schools Receiving
  Grants) * 100
