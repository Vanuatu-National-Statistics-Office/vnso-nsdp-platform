  The "Proportion of Targets Met in the National Environment Policy and
  Implementation Plan 2016-2030" indicator measures the percentage of the
  specific targets set out in the National Environment Policy and Implementation
  Plan (NEPIP) for the period 2016-2030 that have been successfully achieved.
  This indicator reflects the progress made in reaching the environmental goals
  and objectives outlined in the policy and implementation plan.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the progress of environmental goals and targets
  established in the NEPIP 2016-2030, which serves as a strategic framework for
  environmental management and sustainability. The policy includes a set of
  defined targets aimed at addressing key environmental challenges, such as
  biodiversity conservation, pollution control, climate change mitigation, and
  sustainable resource management. By measuring the proportion of targets met,
  this indicator provides insights into the effectiveness of the policy
  implementation and the overall success of the plan in achieving its intended
  outcomes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of targets met in the NEPIP 2016-2030 is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness of national environmental policies and ensuring
  accountability in achieving sustainable development goals. Meeting these
  targets is essential for improving environmental quality, protecting natural
  resources, and enhancing the well-being of current and future generations.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Targets Met in the National Environment Policy
  and Implementation Plan 2016-2030," first identify and list all the specific
  targets outlined in the plan. Then, assess the progress made toward each
  target to determine whether it has been fully met, partially met, or not met.
  Next, divide the number of fully met targets by the total number of targets in
  the plan. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of
  targets met as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Targets Met (%) = (Number of Fully Met Targets/Total Number of
  Targets in the NEPIP) * 100
