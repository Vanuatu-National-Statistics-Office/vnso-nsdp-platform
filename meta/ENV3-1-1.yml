  The "Proportion of Government Ministries with Policies, Budgets, and
  Legislation for Climate Change (CC) & Disaster Risk Management (DRM)"
  indicator measures the percentage of government ministries that have formally
  adopted policies, allocated budgets, and enacted legislation specifically
  addressing Climate Change (CC) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM). This
  indicator reflects the level of integration of CC and DRM considerations
  across different sectors of government.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which government ministries are equipped
  with the necessary frameworks—policies, budgets, and legislation—to address
  climate change and disaster risk management. It assesses whether these
  ministries have developed specific strategies, allocated financial resources,
  and passed relevant laws to effectively manage climate risks and reduce
  vulnerabilities to disasters. The indicator provides insights into the
  government's commitment to mainstreaming climate change adaptation and
  disaster risk reduction across all sectors.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of government ministries with CC and DRM policies,
  budgets, and legislation is essential for evaluating the comprehensiveness and
  effectiveness of a government's response to climate change and disaster risks.
  An integrated approach, where all relevant ministries are actively engaged in
  CC and DRM efforts, is critical for building resilience, protecting
  communities, and ensuring sustainable development.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Government Ministries with Policies, Budgets,
  and Legislation for Climate Change (CC) & Disaster Risk Management (DRM),"
  first identify the total number of relevant government ministries. Then,
  collect data on whether each ministry has established policies, allocated
  budgets, and enacted legislation specifically for CC and DRM. Next, count the
  number of ministries that have all three elements in place. Finally, divide
  this number by the total number of relevant ministries and multiply the result
  by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Ministries with CC & DRM Frameworks (%) = (Number of Ministries
  with Policies, Budgets, and Legislation for CC & DRM / Total Number of
  Ministries) × 100
