  The "Proportion of New Buildings in Compliance with the Building Code"
  indicator measures the percentage of newly constructed buildings that meet the
  standards and regulations set forth in the local or national building code.
  Compliance with the building code ensures that buildings are constructed
  safely, sustainably, and in a manner that protects the health and welfare of
  the occupants and the public.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adherence of new buildings to the established
  building codes, which set out the minimum acceptable standards for
  construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, electrical and
  plumbing systems, energy efficiency, and accessibility. The building code is
  designed to ensure that all new buildings are constructed to a standard that
  guarantees safety, durability, and sustainability. By measuring compliance,
  this indicator provides insight into the effectiveness of building regulations
  and enforcement mechanisms.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of new buildings in compliance with the building
  code is crucial for ensuring public safety, environmental sustainability, and
  the long-term resilience of infrastructure. Buildings that do not comply with
  the code may pose significant risks, including structural failures, fire
  hazards, and other safety concerns. Compliance with building codes also
  promotes energy efficiency, accessibility, and environmental protection.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of New Buildings in Compliance with the Building
  Code," first collect data from building inspections to determine the number of
  new buildings that comply with the building code. Then, calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of compliant buildings by the total number
  of new buildings inspected, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of New Buildings in Compliance= (Number of Compliant New
  Buildings/Total Number of New Buildings Inspected)*100
