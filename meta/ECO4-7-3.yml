Definition: >-
  The "Total Annual Remittances as a Proportion of GDP" indicator measures the
  total value of remittances sent by individuals working abroad to their home
  country over the course of a year, expressed as a percentage of the country’s
  Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Remittances include funds transferred by migrant
  workers to family members or others in their country of origin.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the significance of remittances in relation to the
  overall economy by comparing the total value of remittances received to the
  country’s GDP. Remittances are an important source of income for many
  households, contributing to poverty alleviation, household spending, and
  investment in education, health, and housing. By expressing remittances as a
  proportion of GDP, this indicator provides insight into the extent to which
  remittances contribute to the national economy and how dependent the country
  is on external financial inflows from its diaspora
Disaggregation: Country of remittance
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring total annual remittances as a proportion of GDP is essential for
  understanding the economic impact of remittances on the national economy. High
  remittance inflows relative to GDP can indicate a significant reliance on
  external income sources, which can have both positive and negative
  implications. Positively, remittances can help stabilize the economy by
  providing a steady flow of foreign currency and supporting household
  consumption. However, a high dependence on remittances may also suggest
  vulnerabilities, such as exposure to economic downturns in countries where the
  diaspora is concentrated.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute "Total Annual Remittances as a Proportion of GDP," first collect
  data on the total value of remittances received by the country and the GDP for
  the same year. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing the total
  remittances by the GDP and multiplying by 100 to express the result as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Remittances as a Proportion of GDP (%) = (Total Annual Remittances/GDP) * 100
