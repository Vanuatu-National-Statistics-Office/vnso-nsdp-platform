  The "Proportion of Licensees Harvesting Within Their Allocated Quota"
  indicator measures the percentage of licensed operators who are harvesting
  natural resources, such as timber, fish, or minerals, within the limits set by
  their allocated quota. Alternatively, the "Proportion of Licensee Operations
  Being Monitored" indicator measures the percentage of licensed operations that
  are actively monitored to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory
  requirements, including quota adherence.
Concept: >-
  These indicators track compliance and enforcement within resource extraction
  industries. The "Proportion of Licensees Harvesting Within Their Allocated
  Quota" focuses on the extent to which licensees adhere to the resource limits
  assigned to them, ensuring sustainable resource use. The "Proportion of
  Licensee Operations Being Monitored" reflects the level of oversight by
  regulatory authorities to ensure that operations are conducted legally and
  sustainably.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring these indicators is essential for ensuring sustainable management
  of natural resources. Compliance with quotas helps prevent over-extraction,
  protects ecosystems, and maintains the long-term viability of resources.
  Effective monitoring of licensee operations ensures that regulations are
  enforced, reducing the likelihood of illegal activities and over-harvesting.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Proportion of Licensees Harvesting Within Their Allocated
  Quota," first gather data on the total number of licensed operators and the
  number of those adhering to their quotas. Then, divide the number of compliant
  licensees by the total number of licensees and multiply by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.


  To compute the "Proportion of Licensee Operations Being Monitored," first
  collect data on the total number of licensed operations and the number being
  actively monitored. Then, divide the number of monitored operations by the
  total number of licensee operations and multiply by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Licensees Complying with Quotas (%) = (Number of Licenses
  Harvesting Within Quota/Total Number of Licenses) * 100


  Proportion of Licensees being Monitored (%) = (Number of Licenses
  Monitored/Total Number of Licenses) * 100
