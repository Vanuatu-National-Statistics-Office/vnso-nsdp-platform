Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Households Engaged in Production of Food for Own
  Consumption" indicator measures the percentage of households within a given
  population that are involved in the production of food primarily for their own
  consumption. This includes activities such as home gardening, subsistence
  farming, livestock rearing, and other forms of food production intended to
  meet the household's dietary needs.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which households rely on self-produced
  food as a part of their food security strategy. In many regions, particularly
  in rural areas, households engage in food production to reduce their
  dependence on market-purchased food, enhance food security, and maintain
  traditional agricultural practices. The indicator provides insight into the
  prevalence of subsistence farming and the role of household food production in
  ensuring access to nutritious food.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of households engaged in food production for own
  consumption is essential for understanding food security, rural livelihoods,
  and agricultural practices within a population. A higher proportion of
  households engaged in such activities may indicate a reliance on subsistence
  farming, which can be critical for food security, particularly in areas with
  limited access to markets or during times of economic hardship. Conversely, a
  lower proportion might suggest a shift towards market dependency for food or
  increased urbanization.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Households Engaged in Production of Food for Own
  Consumption," first collect data on the number of households involved in food
  production primarily for their own dietary needs. Then, obtain the total
  number of households in the population or region being studied. Calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of households engaged in food production by
  the total number of households, and multiply by 100 to express it as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Households Engaged in Food Production (%) = (Number Households
  Engaged in Food Production for Own Consumption/Total Number of Households) *
  100
