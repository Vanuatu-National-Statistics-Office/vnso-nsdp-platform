Definition: >-
  The "Average Incidence of Food Poverty at the Household Level (Food Poverty
  Line)" indicator measures the proportion of households whose per capita income
  or expenditure falls below the Food Poverty Line (FPL), indicating that these
  households do not have sufficient resources to afford the minimum amount of
  food required to meet basic nutritional needs. The indicator is typically
  expressed as a percentage and reflects the severity of food poverty within a
  population.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent of food poverty at the household level by
  assessing the average incidence across the population. The Food Poverty Line
  (FPL) is a threshold that represents the minimum income or expenditure
  required for an individual or household to afford a basic, nutritionally
  adequate diet. Households with incomes or expenditures below this threshold
  are considered to be living in food poverty. The indicator provides insights
  into the prevalence and distribution of food insecurity within a population,
  highlighting the vulnerability of certain households to hunger and
  malnutrition.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the average incidence of food poverty at the household level is
  crucial for understanding the depth and breadth of food insecurity within a
  community, region, or country. A high incidence of food poverty indicates that
  a significant proportion of households are unable to meet their basic
  nutritional needs, which can lead to adverse health outcomes, reduced
  productivity, and social instability.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Average Incidence of Food Poverty at the Household Level (Food
  Poverty Line)," first collect data on household income or expenditure levels.
  Define the Food Poverty Line (FPL), which represents the minimum income or
  expenditure required for a basic, nutritionally adequate diet. Identify the
  households whose income or expenditure falls below this threshold. Calculate
  the average incidence of food poverty by dividing the number of households
  below the FPL by the total number of households surveyed, and multiply by 100
  to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Average Incidence of Food Poverty (%) = (Number of Households Below the
  FPL/Total Number of Households Surveyed) * 100
