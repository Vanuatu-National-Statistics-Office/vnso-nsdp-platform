Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Households Sourcing Energy for Lighting from Renewable
  Sources" indicator measures the percentage of households that use renewable
  energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, or biomass, as their primary
  source of energy for lighting. This indicator reflects the extent to which
  renewable energy is being adopted at the household level for lighting
  purposes.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption of renewable energy technologies in
  households specifically for lighting. Renewable energy sources are sustainable
  and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional fossil fuels,
  reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on non-renewable energy. The
  indicator provides insights into the penetration of renewable energy in the
  residential sector, which is a key component of broader efforts to transition
  to a sustainable energy future.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of households sourcing energy for lighting from
  renewable sources is crucial for assessing progress towards energy
  sustainability and environmental goals. A higher proportion indicates a
  successful uptake of renewable energy technologies, contributing to reduced
  carbon emissions, lower energy costs, and enhanced energy security. It also
  reflects the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed at promoting
  renewable energy adoption at the household level. Conversely, a lower
  proportion may suggest barriers to access, such as high costs, lack of
  infrastructure, or limited awareness.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Proportion of Households Sourcing Energy for Lighting from
  Renewable Sources," first collect data on the energy sources used by
  households for lighting through surveys or census data. Identify the number of
  households that use renewable energy sources as their primary source of
  lighting. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing the number of these
  households by the total number of households surveyed, and multiply by 100 to
  express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Households Using Renewable Energy for Lighting= (Number of
  Households Using Renewable Sources/Total Number of Households Surveyed)*100
