  The "Total Number of Annual Community Engagement Activities Undertaken by
  National Law Enforcement Officers" indicator measures the total number of
  community-oriented activities, programs, or events conducted by national law
  enforcement officers within a calendar year. These activities aim to build
  trust, foster positive relationships, and collaborate with community members
  to improve public safety and security.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efforts of national law enforcement agencies to
  engage with the community through various activities such as public safety
  workshops, crime prevention programs, school visits, neighbourhood patrols,
  town hall meetings, and other outreach initiatives. Community engagement is a
  critical aspect of modern policing, emphasizing the importance of
  collaboration between law enforcement and the communities they serve to
  prevent crime, reduce fear, and enhance overall safety.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of community engagement activities is essential for
  assessing the commitment of national law enforcement agencies to community
  policing principles. High levels of engagement indicate proactive efforts by
  law enforcement to connect with the community, build mutual trust, and work
  collaboratively to address local safety concerns. Conversely, low levels of
  engagement may suggest a need for increased focus on relationship-building and
  community involvement.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Annual Community Engagement Activities
  Undertaken by National Law Enforcement Officers," first identify and list all
  relevant community engagement activities conducted by law enforcement officers
  within the specified year. Then, collect data on the number of these
  activities from official records or reports. Finally, count the total number
  of community engagement activities to determine the indicator value.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Community Engagement Activities = Sum of All Community
  Engagement Activities Conducted in One Year
