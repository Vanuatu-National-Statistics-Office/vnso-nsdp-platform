  Monitoring government budget allocation by ministry is essential for assessing
  how public resources are distributed across policy areas. It provides insight
  into government priorities and commitments, such as education, health, and

  time can reveal changes in focus or responses to macroeconomic conditions and
  sectoral needs.
