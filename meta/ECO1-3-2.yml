  The "Debt Ratio to GDP (Inclusive of SOE-Generated Debt)" indicator measures
  the ratio of a country's total public debt, including debt generated by
  State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This
  indicator expresses the total public debt as a percentage of the country's
  GDP, providing an overview of the debt burden relative to the size of the
  economy.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the level of public debt, including liabilities incurred
  by SOEs, in relation to the overall economic output. The inclusion of
  SOE-generated debt in this measure ensures that all public sector liabilities
  are accounted for, offering a comprehensive view of the country's debt
  obligations. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a widely used metric to assess a
  country's ability to manage and repay its debt, as it relates the total debt
  to the economic output that can be leveraged for debt servicing.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the debt ratio to GDP, including SOE-generated debt, is crucial for
  assessing the fiscal health and sustainability of a country. A high
  debt-to-GDP ratio may indicate that a country could face difficulties in
  meeting its debt obligations without compromising economic growth, while a
  lower ratio suggests a more manageable debt burden. Including SOE debt
  provides a fuller picture of potential liabilities that could impact the
  government's finances.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Debt Ratio to GDP (Inclusive of SOE-Generated Debt)," first
  collect data on the total public debt, including debt generated by State-Owned
  Enterprises (SOEs), and the GDP for the same reporting period. Then, calculate
  the debt-to-GDP ratio by dividing the total public debt by the GDP


  Formula:

  Debt Ratio to GDP= Total Public Debt including SOE debt/GDP
