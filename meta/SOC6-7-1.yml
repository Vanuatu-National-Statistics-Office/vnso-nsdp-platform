  for news is crucial for assessing the accessibility and effectiveness of
  information dissemination in society. High usage of diverse media platforms
  indicates that a wide range of the population is staying informed through
  various channels, which is essential for an informed citizenry. It also
  highlights the penetration of digital media and the continued relevance of

MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population Utilizing Media Outlets for News
  Including: Newspapers, Mobile Phones, Radio, Television, and Internet," first
  design and administer a survey that asks respondents about their use of
  various media outlets to access news. Then, identify and count the number of
  respondents who report using each media outlet. Divide the number of
  respondents using each outlet by the total number of respondents, and multiply
  the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Population Using Media Outlets (%) = (Number of People Using Any
  Media Outlet for News/Total Population) * 100
