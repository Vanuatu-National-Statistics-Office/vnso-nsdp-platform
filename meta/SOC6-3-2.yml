Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Population with an Overall Positive Assessment of Their
  Local Elected Officials" indicator measures the percentage of individuals
  within a community or region who express a favourable opinion of their local
  elected officials. This assessment typically includes factors such as the
  officials' performance, integrity, responsiveness, and effectiveness in
  addressing local issues.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks public satisfaction and confidence in local governance.
  Local elected officials, such as mayors, council members, and other
  representatives, play a critical role in addressing the needs and concerns of
  their constituents. A positive assessment from the population indicates that
  these officials are perceived as effective and trustworthy leaders who are
  responsive to the needs of the community.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with a positive assessment of
  their local elected officials is crucial for understanding the level of public
  trust and satisfaction with local governance. High levels of positive
  assessment suggest that officials are meeting the expectations of their
  constituents and are effectively addressing local challenges. Conversely, low
  levels of positive assessment may indicate dissatisfaction with leadership,
  governance issues, or a disconnect between officials and the community.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with an Overall Positive Assessment
  of Their Local Elected Officials," first design and administer a survey to a
  representative sample of the population, asking respondents to rate their
  satisfaction with their local elected officials. Then, identify the number of
  respondents who provide a positive assessment. Divide this number by the total
  number of respondents and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion
  as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Positive Assessments (%) = (Number of Positive Assessments/Total
  Number of Respondents) * 100
