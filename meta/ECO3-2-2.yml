Definition: >-
  The "Annual Change in Tourism by Air and Sea Arrivals" indicator measures the
  year-over-year percentage change in the number of tourists who arrive in a
  country or region by air and sea. This indicator reflects the growth or
  decline in tourism activity based on the volume of visitors entering through
  airports and seaports.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the fluctuation in the number of tourists arriving by
  air and sea, providing a clear picture of trends in tourism demand. By
  monitoring both air and sea arrivals, the indicator captures the overall
  accessibility of a destination and the effectiveness of transportation
  infrastructure in supporting tourism. The indicator is useful for
  understanding the dynamics of tourism flows, including seasonal variations,
  the impact of marketing campaigns, and external factors such as economic
  conditions, travel restrictions, or global events.
Disaggregation: Mode of Arrival
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the annual change in tourism by air and sea arrivals is crucial for
  assessing the performance and growth of the tourism sector. A positive change
  indicates an increase in the number of tourists, which can lead to greater
  economic benefits, including higher spending, job creation, and increased
  demand for tourism-related services. Conversely, a negative change may signal
  challenges such as decreased competitiveness, unfavourable economic
  conditions, or external shocks.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Annual Change in Tourism by Air and Sea Arrivals," first
  collect data on the total number of tourists arriving by air and sea for the
  current and previous years. Calculate the change by subtracting the previous
  year’s total from the current year’s total. Then, divide the change by the
  previous year’s total and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage,
  representing the annual growth or decline in tourism arrivals.


  Formula:

  Annual Change in Tourism by Air (%)= ((Total Arrivals in Current Year – Total
  Arrivals in Previous Year)/Total Arrivals in Previous Year)*100

  Annual Change in Tourism by Sea Arrivals (%)= ((Total Arrivals in Current Year
  – Total Arrivals in Previous Year)/Total Arrivals in Previous Year)*100
