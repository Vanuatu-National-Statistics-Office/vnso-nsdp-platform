  The "Proportion of Government Offices and Public Facilities with Ramp Access
  or Some Disability-Friendly Rating" indicator measures the percentage of
  government offices and public facilities that are equipped with ramps or have
  received a disability-friendly rating based on accessibility standards. This
  includes physical modifications such as ramps, elevators, accessible
  restrooms, and other features that ensure accessibility for people with
  disabilities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the accessibility of public buildings and facilities for
  people with disabilities. Accessibility is a critical aspect of inclusivity,
  enabling people with mobility challenges or other disabilities to access
  public services, participate in civic activities, and utilize government
  facilities. A disability-friendly rating is typically based on criteria that
  assess whether a building or facility meets specific standards for
  accessibility.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of government offices and public facilities with
  ramp access or a disability-friendly rating is essential for assessing
  progress towards creating an inclusive and accessible environment for all
  citizens. High levels of accessibility in public facilities indicate a
  commitment to inclusivity and the rights of people with disabilities, ensuring
  they have equal access to public services and opportunities.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Proportion of Government Offices and Public Facilities with
  Ramp Access or Some Disability-Friendly Rating," first identify and list all
  relevant government offices and public facilities within the specified area.
  Then, assess each facility for the presence of accessibility features such as
  ramps or whether it meets the criteria for a disability-friendly rating. Next,
  collect data on the number of facilities that have ramp access or a
  disability-friendly rating, and divide this by the total number of facilities
  assessed. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Accessible Facilities (%) = (Number of Accessible Government
  Offices and Public Facilities/Total Number of Government Offices and Public
  Facilities Assessed) * 100
