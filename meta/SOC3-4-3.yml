  The "Percentage of Attributes Attained Based on International Health
  Regulation Index (IHR) Component 2" indicator measures the proportion of key
  attributes or capacities that a country has achieved under Component 2 of the
  International Health Regulations (IHR) Index. Component 2 typically relates to
  a specific set of public health capacities required for effective disease
  prevention, detection, and response as defined by the World Health
  Organization (WHO).
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the progress of a country in meeting the public health
  capacities outlined in Component 2 of the IHR Index. The IHR is a legally
  binding agreement between countries to build and maintain core public health
  capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health events of
  international concern. Component 2 focuses on specific attributes such as
  surveillance, laboratory capacity, response readiness, or other essential
  health security measures.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of attributes attained based on the IHR Index
  Component 2 is crucial for assessing a country’s preparedness and ability to
  manage public health risks and emergencies. High attainment indicates that the
  country is well-equipped to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats,
  thereby contributing to global health security. Conversely, low attainment may
  signal gaps in public health infrastructure and capabilities, necessitating
  targeted interventions.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Attributes Attained Based on International
  Health Regulation Index (IHR) Component 2," first identify the specific
  attributes required under Component 2 of the IHR Index. Then, assess the
  extent to which each attribute has been attained. Next, count the number of
  attributes that have been fully attained and divide this by the total number
  of attributes in Component 2. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express
  the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Attributes Attained (%) = (Number of Fully Attained
  Attributes/Total Number of Attributes in IHR Component 2) * 100
