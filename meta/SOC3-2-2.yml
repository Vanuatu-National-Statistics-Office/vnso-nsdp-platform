Definition: >-
  The "Incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) per 100,000 Population" indicator measures
  the number of new and relapse cases of tuberculosis (TB) that occur in a
  population over a specified period, usually one year, expressed per 100,000
  individuals. TB is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts
  of the body.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the rate at which TB is occurring in the population,
  providing a measure of the burden of the disease and the effectiveness of
  public health interventions aimed at preventing and controlling TB. The
  incidence rate is a key metric for understanding the spread of TB within a
  community and assessing the impact of TB control programs.

Rationale: ''
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Incidence of TB per 100,000 Population," first collect data on
  the number of new and relapse TB cases diagnosed within the specified period.
  Then, obtain the total population size for the same period. Next, divide the
  total number of TB cases by the total population, and multiply the result by
  100,000 to express the incidence rate per 100,000 population.


  Formula:

  TB Incidence Rate (per 100,000 population) = (Number of New and Relapse TB
  Cases/Total Population) * 100,000
