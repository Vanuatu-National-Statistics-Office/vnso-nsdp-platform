Proxy: Yes (Production Measured by International Exports Only)
Definition: ' The "Level of Production of Major Commodities Including Beef, Coconut Oil, Cocoa, Copra, Kava, Wood, and Coffee" indicator measures the total quantity of these key agricultural and forestry commodities produced within a country over a specific period. This indicator reflects the output of these major commodities, which are critical to the country’s economy and export markets.'
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the production levels of essential commodities such as
  beef, coconut oil, cocoa, copra, kava, wood, and coffee. These commodities are
  significant contributors to the agricultural and forestry sectors, which play
  a vital role in the country’s economy. The production level is an important
  measure of the agricultural sector's performance, indicating the ability to
  meet domestic demand and contribute to exports. It also provides insights into
  the health of the sector, including productivity, resource availability, and
  market conditions.
Disaggregation: 'Commodity, Country '
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the level of production of these major commodities is crucial for
  understanding the agricultural and forestry sectors' contributions to the
  national economy. These commodities are often key exports and sources of
  income for rural communities. A higher level of production typically indicates
  a robust and productive sector, which can enhance food security, generate
  employment, and increase export revenues. Conversely, a decline in production
  could signal challenges such as adverse weather conditions, resource
  constraints, or market disruptions.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Level of Production of Major Commodities Including Beef,
  Coconut Oil, Cocoa, Copra, Kava, Wood, and Coffee," first collect data on the
  total quantity and total value of each commodity produced during the reporting
  period. Sum the production quantities and values for each commodity to
  determine the total production level for each item. 


  Formula:

  Total Production Quantity= Total Production Quantity of (Beef + Coconut Oil +
  Cocoa + Copra + Kava)

  Total Production Value= Total Production Value of (Beef + Coconut Oil + Cocoa
  + Copra + Kava)
