  The "Proportion of Funding Requested by the Department of Environmental
  Protection & Conservation (DEPC) in Support of Sustainable Development
  Approved Through the National Planning Process (NPP)/Percentage of Government
  Expenditure for Environmental Activities" indicator measures the percentage of
  funding requested by the DEPC for sustainable development initiatives that is
  approved through the National Planning Process. It also measures the
  proportion of total government expenditure allocated to environmental
  activities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks two key aspects of environmental funding: (1) the
  success rate of the DEPC in securing funding for sustainable development
  projects through the NPP, and (2) the share of government spending dedicated
  to environmental activities. It reflects the government's commitment to
  supporting environmental protection and sustainable development through
  adequate budget allocations.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of funding approved for DEPC initiatives and the
  percentage of government expenditure allocated to environmental activities is
  essential for assessing the prioritization of environmental sustainability in
  national budgeting and planning processes. Adequate funding is critical for
  the DEPC to implement effective policies, programs, and projects aimed at
  conserving natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable
  development.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Funding Requested by DEPC Approved Through the
  National Planning Process" and the "Percentage of Government Expenditure for
  Environmental Activities," first collect data on the total amount of funding
  requested by the DEPC and the amount approved through the NPP. Then, gather
  data on the total government expenditure and the portion allocated to
  environmental activities. For the DEPC funding proportion, divide the approved
  amount by the requested amount, and for the government expenditure percentage,
  divide the expenditure on environmental activities by the total government
  expenditure. Finally, multiply both results by 100 to express them as
  percentages.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Approved Funding (%) = (Amount of DEPC Funding Approved Through
  NPP/Total Amount of DEPC Funding Requested) * 100
