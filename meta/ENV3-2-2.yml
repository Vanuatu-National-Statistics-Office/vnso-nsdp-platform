Proxy: 'No'
Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Population with Access to Technologies That Convey Early
  Warnings" indicator measures the percentage of the population that has access
  to technologies designed to deliver early warnings for various hazards, such
  as natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones) or other
  emergencies. These technologies may include mobile phones, radio, television,
  sirens, and internet-based systems.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and reach of early warning technologies
  among the population. Access to such technologies is crucial for timely
  dissemination of critical information that can help individuals and
  communities take preventive actions, evacuate if necessary, and reduce the
  risk of harm. The indicator provides insights into the effectiveness and
  inclusiveness of early warning systems in reaching vulnerable and remote
  populations.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with access to early warning
  technologies is essential for assessing the effectiveness of disaster
  preparedness and response systems. Timely access to early warnings can save
  lives, reduce injuries, and minimize property damage by allowing people to act
  quickly in response to impending hazards.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Access to Technologies That
  Convey Early Warnings," first collect data on the number of people who have
  access to technologies capable of delivering early warnings, such as mobile
  phones, radios, televisions, and internet services. Then, determine the total
  population of the area being assessed. Calculate the proportion by dividing
  the number of people with access to early warning technologies by the total
  population, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Access to Early Warning Technologies (%) =
  (Number of People with Access to Early Warning Technologies/Total Population)
  * 100
