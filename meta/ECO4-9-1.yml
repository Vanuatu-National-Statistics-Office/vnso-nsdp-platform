  The "Total Number of Public/Private Joint Ventures in Operation" indicator
  measures the total count of joint ventures that involve partnerships between
  public sector entities (such as government agencies or state-owned
  enterprises) and private sector companies that are actively operating within a
  country or region at a given time. These joint ventures typically involve
  shared ownership, management, and risks between the public and private
  partners.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the collaboration between public and private sectors
  through joint ventures, which are strategic alliances aimed at leveraging the
  strengths of both sectors to achieve common goals. Public/private joint
  ventures are often formed to undertake large-scale projects, such as
  infrastructure development, resource management, or service delivery, where
  both parties contribute resources, expertise, and capital. By counting the
  number of such ventures in operation, the indicator provides insight into the
  level of public-private collaboration and the role of these partnerships in
  driving economic development and public service provision.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of public/private joint ventures in operation is
  essential for understanding the extent of collaboration between the public and
  private sectors in achieving economic and developmental objectives. A higher
  number of joint ventures may indicate a strong partnership between the two
  sectors, leading to enhanced resource mobilization, innovation, and efficient
  project execution. These ventures can be crucial in addressing infrastructure
  gaps, improving public services, and fostering economic growth
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Public/Private Joint Ventures in Operation,"
  first collect data on the total number of joint ventures involving public and
  private sector entities that are currently active within the country or
  region. Verify that these joint ventures are operational, meaning they are
  engaged in ongoing business activities or projects. Finally, sum the total
  number of verified active joint ventures to determine the overall count.
