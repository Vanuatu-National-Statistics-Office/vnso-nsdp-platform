  The "Proportion of Vehicles That Comply with Emission Standards" indicator
  measures the percentage of vehicles within a given region or country that meet
  established emission standards. These standards are regulations that limit the
  amount of pollutants (such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate
  matter, and hydrocarbons) that vehicles are allowed to emit.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the compliance of vehicles with environmental
  regulations designed to control air pollution from transportation sources.
  Emission standards are set by governments to reduce the harmful environmental
  and health impacts of vehicle emissions. By measuring the proportion of
  vehicles that comply with these standards, the indicator provides insight into
  the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing air pollution and promoting
  cleaner transportation options.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of vehicles that comply with emission standards is
  crucial for assessing progress in reducing air pollution and protecting public
  health. Vehicles that do not meet emission standards contribute significantly
  to air quality problems, leading to respiratory issues, environmental
  degradation, and climate change.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Vehicles That Comply with Emission Standards,"
  first collect data on the total number of vehicles in the region or country.
  Then, gather data on the number of vehicles that have been tested and
  certified as meeting the required emission standards. Next, divide the number
  of vehicles that comply with emission standards by the total number of
  vehicles. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Vehicles Complying with Emission Standards (%) = (Number of
  Vehicles Complying with Emission Standards/Total Number of Vehicles) * 100
