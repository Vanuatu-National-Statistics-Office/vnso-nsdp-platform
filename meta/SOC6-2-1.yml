Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of SOEs and Statutory Bodies Submitting Annual Reports to
  Their Boards of Directors" indicator measures the percentage of state-owned
  enterprises (SOEs) and statutory bodies that submit their annual financial and
  operational reports to their respective boards of directors within a specified
  reporting period. The annual report typically includes financial statements,
  performance evaluations, and other relevant information about the entity's
  activities during the year.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the accountability and transparency practices of SOEs
  and statutory bodies by monitoring their compliance with the requirement to
  submit annual reports to their boards of directors. Annual reporting is a
  critical governance practice that ensures boards are informed about the
  financial health, operational performance, and strategic direction of the
  entities they oversee. Regular submission of these reports is essential for
  effective oversight, decision-making, and ensuring that these entities are
  operating in line with their mandates.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of SOEs and statutory bodies that submit annual
  reports is important for assessing the effectiveness of governance and
  accountability mechanisms within the public sector. High compliance rates
  indicate that these entities are adhering to good governance practices,
  maintaining transparency, and enabling their boards to fulfil their oversight
  responsibilities. Conversely, low compliance rates may suggest governance
  weaknesses, a lack of transparency, or potential issues in the management of
  these entities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of SOEs and Statutory Bodies Submitting Annual
  Reports to Their Boards of Directors," first identify and list all relevant
  SOEs and statutory bodies required to submit annual reports. Then, collect
  data on how many of these entities have submitted their reports within the
  specified period. Divide the number of entities that have submitted reports by
  the total number of relevant entities, and multiply the result by 100 to
  express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Reporting Entities (%) = (Number of SOEs/Statutory Bodies
  Submitting Reports/Total Number of SOEs/Statutory Bodies Required tom Submit
  Reports) * 100
