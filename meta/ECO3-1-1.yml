  The "Total Annual Value of Agriculture; Industry; Transport, and Accommodation
  and Food Services as a Proportion of GDP" indicator measures the combined
  economic value generated by the agriculture, industry, transport, and
  accommodation and food services sectors within a country, expressed as a
  percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a given year. This
  indicator provides insight into the contribution of these key sectors to the
  overall economy.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the relative economic importance of agriculture,
  industry, transport, and accommodation and food services within the national
  economy. By expressing the total value of these sectors as a proportion of
  GDP, the indicator highlights the role these sectors play in driving economic
  growth, creating jobs, and supporting national development. The sectors
  included are critical for the functioning of the economy, with agriculture
  providing food and raw materials, industry contributing to manufacturing and
  production, transport enabling the movement of goods and people, and
  accommodation and food services supporting tourism and hospitality.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total annual value of agriculture, industry, transport, and
  accommodation and food services as a proportion of GDP is essential for
  understanding the structure of the economy and the contribution of these
  sectors to economic performance. A higher proportion indicates that these
  sectors are significant drivers of economic activity, while a lower proportion
  may suggest a need for policy intervention or investment to strengthen these
  areas.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Annual Value of Agriculture; Industry; Transport, and
  Accommodation and Food Services as a Proportion of GDP," first collect data on
  the value added by each of these sectors for the reporting year. Then, obtain
  the total GDP for the same period. Calculate the proportion by dividing the
  total value added by these sectors by the total GDP and multiply by 100 to
  express it as a percentage. This percentage represents the contribution of
  these key sectors to the overall economy.


  Formula:

  Proportion of GDP= (Total Value Added by Agriculture, Industry, Transport, and
  Accommodation and Food Services/Total GDP)*100
