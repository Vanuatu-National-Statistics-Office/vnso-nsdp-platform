Definition: >-
  The "Total Number of People Receiving Training in Food Storage and
  Preservation Per Year" indicator measures the total count of individuals who
  have participated in training programs focused on food storage and
  preservation within a given year. These training programs are organized or
  supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, &
  Biosecurity (MALFFB), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or other
  partnered initiatives.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the participation in training programs that aim to
  enhance knowledge and skills in food storage and preservation techniques.
  Effective food storage and preservation are critical for reducing food waste,
  extending the shelf life of food products, and ensuring food security,
  especially in regions where food production is seasonal or where access to
  fresh food may be limited. The training provided through MALFFB, NGOs, and
  other partners is designed to empower individuals, particularly those in rural
  and agricultural communities, with the skills necessary to safely store and
  preserve food, thereby improving household food security and resilience.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of people receiving training in food storage and
  preservation is essential for assessing the outreach and effectiveness of
  capacity-building initiatives aimed at improving food security. Training in
  these areas is crucial for reducing post-harvest losses, ensuring the
  availability of nutritious food throughout the year, and supporting
  sustainable agricultural practices.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of People Receiving Training in Food Storage and
  Preservation Per Year," first collect data on the number of participants in
  each training program organized or supported by the Ministry of Agriculture,
  Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, & Biosecurity (MALFFB), NGOs, and partnered
  initiatives. Verify that the training programs focus on food storage and
  preservation techniques. Then, sum the total number of individuals who
  completed the training across all programs within the year.
