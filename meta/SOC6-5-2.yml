  The "Proportion of Provinces with Up-to-Date Three-Year 'Rolling' Plans
  Submitted to the Department of Local Authorities (DLA)" indicator measures the
  percentage of provinces that have submitted their current and up-to-date
  three-year rolling development plans to the Department of Local Authorities
  (DLA). A "rolling" plan is a strategic document that is regularly updated to
  reflect evolving priorities, challenges, and opportunities over a three-year
  period.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the compliance of provincial governments with the
  requirement to maintain and submit up-to-date three-year rolling plans to the
  DLA. Rolling plans are dynamic planning tools that allow provinces to
  continuously adjust their strategies, projects, and resource allocations to
  address changing circumstances and align with broader national development
  goals. The regular submission of these plans ensures that provincial planning
  is both forward-looking and responsive to emerging needs.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of provinces that submit up-to-date rolling plans is
  crucial for assessing the effectiveness of decentralized planning and
  governance. High submission rates indicate that provinces are actively engaged
  in strategic planning and are complying with national guidelines, which helps
  ensure that local development efforts are coordinated and aligned with
  national objectives. Conversely, low submission rates may suggest challenges
  in planning capacity, resource limitations, or a lack of alignment between
  provincial and national planning processes.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Provinces with Up-to-Date Three-Year 'Rolling'
  Plans Submitted to the Department of Local Authorities (DLA)," first identify
  and list all provinces required to submit these plans. Then, collect data on
  the number of provinces that have submitted up-to-date plans within the
  specified reporting period. Divide the number of provinces that have submitted
  their plans by the total number of provinces, and multiply by 100 to express
  the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Provinces Submitting Plans (%) = (Number of Provinces Submitting
  Up-to-Date Plans/Total Number of Provinces Required to Submit Plans) * 100
