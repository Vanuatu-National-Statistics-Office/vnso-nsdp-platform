Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of All Imported Lighting and Refrigeration Appliances That
  Meet High Energy Efficiency Standards" indicator measures the percentage of
  lighting and refrigeration appliances imported into a country that conform to
  recognized high energy efficiency standards. These standards are typically
  defined by national or international energy efficiency certifications, such as
  ENERGY STAR, EU Energy Label, or similar.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of energy-efficient appliances within the
  market, focusing specifically on imported lighting and refrigeration products.
  Energy efficiency standards are designed to reduce energy consumption and
  lower greenhouse gas emissions by ensuring that appliances operate using less
  power while maintaining performance. By monitoring the proportion of
  energy-efficient imports, this indicator reflects the effectiveness of
  regulations, incentives, and consumer preferences in promoting sustainable
  energy use.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of energy-efficient lighting and refrigeration
  appliances is essential for promoting energy conservation, reducing
  electricity demand, and minimizing environmental impact. Energy-efficient
  appliances contribute to lower utility bills for consumers, reduced strain on
  the energy grid, and decreased carbon emissions.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of All Imported Lighting and Refrigeration
  Appliances That Meet High Energy Efficiency Standards," first collect data on
  the total number of lighting and refrigeration appliances imported into the
  country within a specific period. Then, gather information on how many of
  these imported appliances meet recognized high energy efficiency standards.
  Next, divide the number of energy-efficient appliances by the total number of
  imported appliances. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Energy-Efficient Imports (%) = (Number of Imported Appliances
  Meeting Energy Efficiency Standards/Total Number of Imported Appliances) * 100
