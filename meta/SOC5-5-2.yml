  The "Incidents of Theft and Vandalism Reported Annually to the Police"
  indicator measures the total number of theft and vandalism incidents reported
  to the police within a calendar year. Additionally, the indicator also
  includes the proportion of reported incidents to estimated unreported
  incidents, highlighting the potential gap in crime reporting.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of theft and vandalism as reported to law
  enforcement agencies. Theft refers to the unlawful taking of someone else's
  property, while vandalism involves the intentional destruction or damage to
  property. The indicator also considers the proportion of reported to
  unreported incidents, which provides insights into the actual level of these
  crimes and the effectiveness of crime reporting mechanisms.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of reported incidents of theft and vandalism is crucial
  for understanding crime trends, assessing public safety, and evaluating the
  effectiveness of law enforcement responses. However, not all incidents are
  reported to the police, which can result in underestimations of crime rates.
  Understanding the proportion of reported to unreported incidents helps to
  identify potential barriers to reporting, such as fear of reprisal, lack of
  trust in law enforcement, or perceived triviality of the crime.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Incidents of Theft and Vandalism Reported Annually to the
  Police (and the Proportion of Reported Incidents to Unreported)," first
  collect data on the total number of reported theft and vandalism incidents
  from police records for the specified year. Then, estimate the number of
  unreported incidents using crime victimization surveys or statistical models.
  Next, calculate the proportion of reported incidents to the estimated total
  number of incidents by dividing the number of reported incidents by the sum of
  reported and unreported incidents. Finally, multiply the proportion by 100 to
  express it as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Total Incidents = Reported Incidents + Estimated Unreported Incidents 

  Proportion of Reported Incidents (%) = (Reported Incidents/Total Incidents) *
  100
