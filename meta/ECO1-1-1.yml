Definition: >-
  The "Change in Underlying Inflation Rate (CPI Analysis)" indicator measures
  the year-over-year or period-over-period change in the underlying inflation
  rate, which is derived from the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Underlying
  inflation, also known as core inflation, typically excludes volatile items
  such as food and energy prices, providing a more stable measure of
  inflationary trends.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the change in underlying inflation, focusing on the
  sustained movements in prices of goods and services that are less susceptible
  to short-term volatility. The underlying inflation rate is an essential metric
  for policymakers and economists as it helps to gauge the true inflationary
  pressure in the economy, excluding temporary fluctuations that could distort
  the broader inflation picture
Disaggregation: None
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in the underlying inflation rate is crucial for
  assessing the stability of prices in an economy. Unlike headline inflation,
  which can be influenced by short-term price changes in volatile sectors, the
  underlying inflation rate offers a clearer view of long-term inflation trends.
  Understanding changes in the underlying inflation rate can help in making
  informed decisions to maintain price stability, guide interest rates, and
  manage economic growth.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Change in Underlying Inflation Rate (CPI Analysis)," first
  collect data on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) components, focusing on the
  core basket of goods and services that exclude volatile items like food and
  energy. Then, calculate the underlying inflation rate based on these core
  components. Finally, determine the change in the underlying inflation rate by
  comparing the rate for the current period with that of the previous period,
  and express the change in percentage terms.


  Formula: 

  Change in Underlying Inflation Rate= (Underlying Inflation Rate (current
  period) – Underlying Inflation Rate (previous period)/Underlying Inflation
  Rate (previous period))*100
