  The "Proportion of Farmers Involved in Integrated Farming Practices" indicator
  measures the percentage of farmers who implement integrated farming practices
  within their agricultural operations. Integrated farming practices refer to
  the combination of various agricultural activities—such as crop cultivation,
  livestock rearing, aquaculture, and agroforestry—on the same farm to optimize
  resource use, enhance productivity, and promote sustainability.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption of integrated farming systems, which are
  designed to create synergies between different agricultural activities.
  Integrated farming practices aim to improve farm efficiency by utilizing the
  waste or by-products of one activity as inputs for another (e.g., using
  livestock manure as fertilizer for crops). These practices contribute to
  sustainable agriculture by reducing reliance on external inputs, improving
  soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and increasing resilience to
  environmental stresses.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of farmers involved in integrated farming practices
  is crucial for understanding the extent of sustainable agricultural practices
  within a region or country. Integrated farming can lead to more efficient use
  of resources, reduced environmental impact, and increased farm profitability.
  This indicator helps assess the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed
  at encouraging integrated farming and provides insights into the overall
  sustainability of the agricultural sector.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Proportion of Farmers Involved in Integrated Farming
  Practices," first collect data on the total number of farmers in the region or
  country, and then gather data on the number of farmers who are actively
  practicing integrated farming. Next, divide the number of farmers involved in
  integrated farming by the total number of farmers. Finally, multiply the
  result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Farmers Involved in Integrated Farming Practices (%) = (Number
  of Farmers Practicing Integrated Farming/Total Number of Farmers) * 100
