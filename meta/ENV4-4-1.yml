  The "Level of Compliance by Vanuatu with Respect to Its National Fishing Fleet
  Within the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations" indicator measures the
  extent to which Vanuatu’s national fishing fleet adheres to the rules,
  regulations, and conservation measures established by Regional Fisheries
  Management Organisations (RFMOs). Compliance includes meeting reporting
  requirements, adhering to catch limits, following gear restrictions, and
  implementing other management measures designed to ensure sustainable fishing
  practices.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks Vanuatu’s compliance with the obligations and standards
  set by RFMOs, which are international organizations responsible for the
  management of fish stocks in specific regions. The RFMOs play a critical role
  in conserving and managing fishery resources through the adoption of
  management measures that member countries, including Vanuatu, are required to
  follow. The indicator reflects Vanuatu's commitment to sustainable fisheries
  management and its role in contributing to the conservation of marine
  resources at a regional and international level.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the level of compliance by Vanuatu’s national fishing fleet within
  RFMOs is crucial for ensuring that the country meets its international
  obligations and contributes to the sustainable management of shared fishery
  resources. High levels of compliance help protect fish stocks, prevent
  overfishing, and maintain the health of marine ecosystems.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Level of Compliance by Vanuatu with Respect to Its National
  Fishing Fleet Within the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations," first
  identify the specific regulations and conservation measures established by the
  relevant RFMOs that apply to Vanuatu’s fishing fleet. Assess the fleet’s
  adherence to these regulations by reviewing RFMO reports, inspection records,
  and other relevant data. Calculate the level of compliance by dividing the
  number of RFMO regulations fully complied with by the total number of
  applicable RFMO regulations, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a
  percentage.



  Formula:

  Level of Compliance (%) = (Number of RFMO Regulations Fully Complied
  With/Total Number of Applicable RFMO Regulations) * 100
