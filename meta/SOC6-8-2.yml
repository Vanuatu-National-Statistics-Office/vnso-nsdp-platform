  The "Percentage of Aid for the Government Sector Using Vanuatu Government
  Public Financial Management (PFM) Systems" indicator measures the proportion
  of total aid provided to the government sector that is managed through the
  Vanuatu government's public financial management (PFM) systems. These systems
  include budgeting, accounting, auditing, procurement, and reporting processes
  that are part of the national government’s financial infrastructure.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which external aid provided to the Vanuatu
  government is channeled through the country’s own PFM systems. Using the
  national PFM systems for aid management enhances ownership, strengthens
  financial accountability, and aligns external resources with national
  priorities and processes. The integration of aid into government systems is
  considered a key aspect of effective aid management and development
  cooperation.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of aid using Vanuatu’s PFM systems is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of aid management. When aid is
  managed through the country’s own PFM systems, it supports capacity building,
  improves transparency, and ensures better alignment with national development
  plans. This approach also reduces the risks associated with parallel systems,
  such as duplication of efforts and lack of accountability. A higher percentage
  indicates stronger integration of aid into the national financial framework,
  while a lower percentage may highlight reliance on external systems and
  potential challenges in aligning aid with government processes.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Aid for the Government Sector Using Vanuatu
  Government Public Financial Management (PFM) Systems," first collect data on
  the total amount of aid provided to the government sector during the reporting
  period. Then, collect data on the amount of this aid that is managed through
  the Vanuatu government’s PFM systems. Divide the amount of aid using PFM
  systems by the total amount of aid provided, and multiply the result by 100 to
  express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Aid Using PFM Systems (%) = 9Aid Managed through Vanuatu’s PFM
  Systems/Total Aid Provided to the Government Sector) * 100
