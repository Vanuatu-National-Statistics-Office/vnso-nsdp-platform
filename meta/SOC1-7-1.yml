Proxy: 'No'
Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Population with Free Access to Traditional Lands, Forest,
  and Marine Resources" indicator measures the percentage of the population that
  has unrestricted or free access to use and manage traditional lands, forests,
  and marine resources. This access is typically rooted in customary rights and
  practices that have been established over generations within indigenous or
  local communities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which individuals and communities maintain
  access to their traditional lands and natural resources, including forests and
  marine areas. These resources are vital for livelihoods, cultural practices,
  and community well-being. Access to traditional lands and resources is often
  governed by customary laws and traditions, which dictate how resources are
  used, managed, and shared among community members.
Disaggregation: 'Region, Sex'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with free access to traditional
  lands, forest, and marine resources is essential for understanding the status
  of customary rights and the sustainability of traditional practices. Access to
  these resources is critical for food security, cultural identity, and economic
  activities in many indigenous and local communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Free Access to Traditional
  Lands, Forest, and Marine Resources," first collect data through surveys or
  community assessments to determine individuals' access to these resources.
  Identify the number of respondents who report having free and unrestricted
  access. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of individuals with
  free access by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express
  the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Free Access (%) = (Number of Individuals with
  Free Access to Traditional Lands, Forests, and Marine Resources/Total
  Population Surveyed) * 100
