  The "Percentage of Grid-Based Electricity Generated from Renewable Energy
  Sources" indicator measures the proportion of electricity supplied to the
  national or regional power grid that is generated from renewable energy
  sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. This indicator
  reflects the share of renewable energy in the overall electricity grid.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the contribution of renewable energy sources to the
  total electricity generated and supplied through the grid. It is an important
  measure of the transition towards sustainable energy systems and the reduction
  of reliance on fossil fuels. By focusing on grid-based electricity, the
  indicator provides insights into how much of the mainstream electricity supply
  is derived from renewable sources, as opposed to conventional sources like
  coal, natural gas, or oil.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources is
  crucial for assessing progress toward energy sustainability and climate change
  mitigation goals. Increasing the share of renewable energy in the electricity
  mix reduces greenhouse gas emissions, enhances energy security, and promotes
  environmental sustainability.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Percentage of Grid-Based Electricity Generated from Renewable
  Energy Sources," first collect data on the total amount of electricity
  generated and supplied to the grid within a specific period. Then, gather data
  on the amount of electricity generated specifically from renewable energy
  sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass, during the same
  period. Next, divide the amount of electricity generated from renewable
  sources by the total amount of electricity generated. Finally, multiply the
  result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Grid-Based Electricity from Renewables (%) = (Electricity
  Generated from Renewable Sources/Total Grid-Based Electricity Generated) * 100
