Definition: >-
  The "Percentage of Climate Change and Disaster-Affected Communities with
  Durable Solutions" indicator measures the proportion of communities affected
  by climate change and disasters that have implemented durable solutions to
  address their vulnerabilities. Durable solutions refer to long-term strategies
  that enable communities to recover, adapt, and thrive despite the impacts of
  climate change and disasters, ensuring sustainable livelihoods, safety, and
  resilience.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness of interventions aimed at helping
  communities recover from and adapt to the impacts of climate change and
  disasters. Durable solutions may include infrastructure improvements,
  relocation to safer areas, sustainable livelihood programs, enhanced disaster
  preparedness, and access to essential services. The indicator reflects the
  success of these interventions in providing lasting benefits and reducing the
  future vulnerability of affected communities.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of climate change and disaster-affected communities
  with durable solutions is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of recovery
  and adaptation efforts. Durable solutions are key to building long-term
  resilience, reducing the risk of future displacement, and ensuring that
  communities can maintain their livelihoods and well-being in the face of
  ongoing environmental challenges.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Climate Change and Disaster-Affected Communities
  with Durable Solutions," first identify and list the communities affected by
  climate change and disasters. Then, assess whether each affected community has
  implemented durable solutions. Next, divide the number of communities with
  durable solutions by the total number of affected communities. Finally,
  multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Communities with Durable Solutions (%) = (Number of Communities
  with Durable Solutions/Total Number of Affected Communities) * 100
