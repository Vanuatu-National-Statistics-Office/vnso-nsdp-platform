  The "Proportion of Youth Aged 14-30 That Feel Valued in Society" indicator
  measures the percentage of young people within the age range of 14 to 30 who
  perceive that they are valued, respected, and recognized as important
  contributors to society. This perception is often gauged through surveys that
  assess youth's feelings of inclusion, respect, and societal worth.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the subjective well-being and social inclusion of youth
  within society. Feeling valued is a critical component of a young person’s
  sense of identity, self-esteem, and belonging. It reflects the extent to which
  youth believe that their opinions, contributions, and existence are respected
  and appreciated by their community, institutions, and society at large. This
  sense of value is essential for positive youth development and active
  participation in social, economic, and political life.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of youth who feel valued in society is crucial for
  understanding their integration, well-being, and potential for civic
  engagement. When young people feel valued, they are more likely to contribute
  positively to their communities, pursue education and employment
  opportunities, and engage in civic activities. Conversely, a low proportion of
  youth feeling valued may indicate issues such as social exclusion,
  discrimination, or lack of opportunities, which can lead to disengagement or
  even antisocial behaviour.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Youth Aged 14-30 That Feel Valued in Society,"
  first design and administer a survey to a representative sample of youth
  within this age range, asking questions that assess their feelings of being
  valued. Then, identify the number of respondents who report feeling valued in
  society. Divide this number by the total number of respondents and multiply
  the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Youth Feeling Valued (%) = (Number of Youth Who Feel
  Valued/Total Number of Youth Surveyed) * 100
