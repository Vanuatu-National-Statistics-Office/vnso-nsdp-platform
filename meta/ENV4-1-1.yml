  The "Proportion of Declared Physical Planning Areas That Have a Physical Plan"
  indicator measures the percentage of officially designated physical planning
  areas that have a comprehensive and approved physical plan in place. A
  physical plan typically outlines land use, infrastructure development,
  environmental conservation, and other spatial planning considerations within a
  specified area.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the progress of urban and regional planning by assessing
  whether designated physical planning areas have been equipped with formal
  plans that guide their development. Physical planning is essential for
  ensuring sustainable land use, coordinating infrastructure development,
  managing natural resources, and mitigating environmental impacts. The
  indicator provides insights into the extent to which planning areas are being
  managed in accordance with established planning principles and regulations.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of declared physical planning areas with physical
  plans is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of spatial planning efforts.
  Having a physical plan in place helps ensure that development within these
  areas is orderly, sustainable, and aligned with broader environmental and
  socio-economic goals.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Declared Physical Planning Areas That Have a
  Physical Plan," first identify and list all officially designated physical
  planning areas. Then, verify whether each area has an approved physical plan
  in place. Next, divide the number of planning areas with approved physical
  plans by the total number of declared planning areas. Finally, multiply the
  result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Areas with Physical Plans (%) = (Number of Declared Areas with a
  Physical Plan/Total Number of Declared Physical Planning Areas) * 100
