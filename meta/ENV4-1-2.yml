  The "Proportion of Directives of the National Land Use Planning Policy
  Implemented" indicator measures the percentage of specific directives or
  actions outlined in the national land use planning policy that have been
  successfully implemented. These directives may include regulations,
  guidelines, initiatives, and other measures intended to guide land use
  planning and management at the national level.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the implementation of the national land use planning
  policy by assessing the extent to which its directives are put into action.
  Land use planning policy directives typically cover a wide range of issues,
  including zoning, land allocation, environmental conservation, infrastructure
  development, and the sustainable use of natural resources. The indicator
  reflects the effectiveness of the policy implementation process and the
  government's commitment to achieving the policy's goals.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of directives implemented from the national land use
  planning policy is crucial for evaluating the success of land use management
  efforts. Effective implementation of these directives ensures that land use is
  organized, sustainable, and aligned with national development objectives.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Directives of the National Land Use Planning
  Policy Implemented," first identify all the directives or action items
  outlined in the national land use planning policy. Assess the implementation
  status of each directive by reviewing relevant government reports and records.
  Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of fully implemented
  directives by the total number of directives in the policy, and multiply by
  100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Directives Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented
  Directives/Total Number of Directives in the Policy) * 100
