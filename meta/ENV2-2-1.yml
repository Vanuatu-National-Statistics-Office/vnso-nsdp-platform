Proxy: 'No'
Definition: >-
  The "Number of Development Projects Complying with Environmental Impact
  Assessment (EIA) Requirements" indicator measures the total count of
  development projects that have successfully completed and adhered to
  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requirements as mandated by national or
  regional regulations. Compliance means that the projects have undergone the
  EIA process, received approval, and are implementing the recommended
  environmental management and mitigation measures.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adherence of development projects to environmental
  regulations through the completion and compliance with Environmental Impact
  Assessments. The EIA is a critical tool used to evaluate the potential
  environmental effects of a proposed project before it proceeds. It ensures
  that environmental considerations are integrated into the decision-making
  process, helping to prevent or minimize negative environmental impacts. The
  indicator provides insights into how well development projects are aligning
  with environmental sustainability standards.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of development projects complying with EIA requirements
  is essential for promoting sustainable development and protecting the
  environment. Compliance with EIA requirements ensures that potential
  environmental risks are identified and addressed, which helps to prevent
  environmental degradation and promotes responsible development. This indicator
  helps policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public understand the
  effectiveness of regulatory frameworks in ensuring that development activities
  are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Development Projects Complying with Environmental
  Impact Assessment (EIA) Requirements," first collect data on all development
  projects that have been subjected to EIA requirements within the specified
  period. Then, verify which of these projects have fully complied with the EIA
  process, including completing the EIA report, obtaining approval from relevant
  authorities, and implementing the recommended environmental management and
  mitigation measures. Finally, count the total number of projects that have
  complied with all EIA requirements.


  Formula:

  Number of Compliant Projects = Total Development Projects Complying with EIA
  Requirements
