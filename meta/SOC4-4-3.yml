Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Laws Reviewed on the Basis of Discriminatory and Gender
  Biased Principles" indicator measures the percentage of existing laws and
  legal provisions that have been formally reviewed to identify and address
  elements of discrimination or gender bias. This review process typically
  involves analyzing the legal text, its application, and its impact to ensure
  that it promotes equality and does not perpetuate discrimination based on
  gender or other protected characteristics.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efforts made by a country or legal body to assess
  and reform its legal framework to eliminate discriminatory and gender-biased
  provisions. Discriminatory laws are those that create or perpetuate
  inequalities between different groups, often to the disadvantage of women or
  marginalized populations. Gender bias in laws can manifest in unequal
  treatment or outcomes for different genders, particularly in areas such as
  family law, labour law, and criminal law.
Disaggregation: 'Type of law (civil, criminal, labour, family law)'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of laws reviewed for discrimination and gender bias
  is crucial for promoting a legal system that upholds the principles of
  equality and justice. The review and revision of discriminatory laws are key
  steps in ensuring that legal frameworks protect the rights of all citizens,
  regardless of gender.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Laws Reviewed on the Basis of Discriminatory and
  Gender Biased Principles," first identify and list all relevant laws that may
  require review for discriminatory and gender-biased content. Then, conduct a
  formal review of these laws. Next, collect data on the number of laws that
  have been reviewed and divide this by the total number of relevant laws.
  Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of reviewed laws
  as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Laws Reviewed (%) = (Number of Laws Reviewed for Discrimination
  and Gender Bias/Total Number of Relevant Laws) * 100
