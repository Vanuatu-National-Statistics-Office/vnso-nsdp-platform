Definition: >-
  The "Interest Rate Level (Average Bank Rate)" indicator measures the average
  interest rate set by commercial banks for loans and deposits within a country
  over a specific period, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate
  (APR). This rate reflects the cost of borrowing money from banks and the
  return on savings or deposits made with banks.

   
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the general level of interest rates within the banking
  sector, providing an average of the rates applied by banks to their lending
  and deposit-taking activities. The average bank rate is a critical component
  of a country’s monetary policy environment and influences the overall cost of
  credit, investment decisions, and savings behaviour. It includes rates for
  various financial products, such as personal loans, mortgages, and savings
  accounts.

Rationale: >+
  Monitoring the average bank interest rate level is essential for understanding
  the monetary conditions within an economy. Interest rates directly impact
  consumer spending, business investment, inflation, and economic growth. Higher
  interest rates typically reduce borrowing and spending, while lower rates
  encourage them.

MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Interest Rate Level (Average Bank Rate)," first collect
  interest rate data from a representative sample of commercial banks within the
  country, including rates for various types of loans and deposits. Then,
  calculate the average bank rate by summing the interest rates from the
  selected banks and dividing by the number of banks in the sample. If detailed
  data is available, compute a weighted average by considering the volume of
  loans or deposits associated with each rate.


  Formula:

  Average Bank Rate= (Total Interest Rates from Selected Banks/Number of Banks
  in Sample)
