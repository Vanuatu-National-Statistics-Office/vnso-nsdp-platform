  The "Proportion of Human Rights Related Conventions Ratified" indicator
  measures the percentage of international human rights conventions that a
  country has ratified out of the total number of relevant conventions available
  for ratification. Ratification refers to the formal approval by a country’s
  government, making the convention legally binding within that country.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks a country’s commitment to upholding and promoting human
  rights on an international level by adhering to global standards. Human rights
  conventions are treaties and agreements developed under the auspices of
  international bodies such as the United Nations, aimed at protecting and
  promoting fundamental human rights and freedoms. Ratifying these conventions
  signifies a country's dedication to aligning its national laws and policies
  with international human rights standards.

  rights, specific groups rights)
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of human rights-related conventions ratified is
  essential for assessing a country's engagement with the international human
  rights framework. High ratification rates indicate a strong commitment to
  protecting human rights and ensuring compliance with global standards.
  Conversely, low ratification rates may suggest reluctance or delays in
  adopting international human rights norms.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Human Rights Related Conventions Ratified,"
  first identify and list all relevant human rights-related conventions open for
  ratification by the country. Then, collect data on the number of these
  conventions that have been ratified by the country. Next, divide the number of
  ratified conventions by the total number of relevant conventions. Finally,
  multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of ratified conventions
  as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Human Rights Conventions Ratified (%) = (Number of Conventions
  Ratified/Total Number of Relevant Human Rights Conventions) * 100
