  The "Reduction in Annual Employment Disciplinary Board Decisions" indicator
  measures the year-over-year decrease in the number of disciplinary decisions
  made by employment disciplinary boards within organizations or across sectors.
  This reduction reflects the effectiveness of efforts to improve workplace
  behaviour, adherence to organizational policies, and the overall work
  environment.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness of workplace management and
  organizational policies in reducing instances of behaviour or actions that
  necessitate disciplinary action. Disciplinary board decisions typically
  involve actions taken against employees for violations of workplace rules,
  misconduct, or failure to meet job performance standards. A reduction in such
  decisions suggests improvements in employee conduct, better management
  practices, or successful implementation of preventive measures such as
  training or policy changes.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the reduction in annual employment disciplinary board decisions is
  important for assessing the impact of initiatives aimed at improving workplace
  behaviour and reducing misconduct. A significant reduction indicates that
  organizations are effectively managing employee conduct, potentially through
  better communication of policies, improved training programs, or stronger
  leadership. Conversely, a lack of reduction or an increase in disciplinary
  decisions may signal underlying issues in the workplace that need to be
  addressed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Reduction in Annual Employment Disciplinary Board Decisions,"
  first collect data on the total number of disciplinary decisions made in the
  current year and the previous year. Then, subtract the number of decisions in
  the current year from the number in the previous year to determine the
  reduction. Divide this reduction by the total number of decisions from the
  previous year and multiply by 100 to express the reduction as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Reduction in Disciplinary Decisions=Disciplinary Decisions in Previous Year –
  Disciplinary Decisions in Current Year

  Percentage Reduction (%) = (Reduction in Disciplinary Decisions/Disciplinary
  Decisions in Previous Year) * 100
