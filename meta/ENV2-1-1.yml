  The "Proportion of 'Blue-Green Growth Friendly' National Policies Fully
  Implemented" indicator measures the percentage of national policies aimed at
  promoting sustainable economic growth that aligns with environmental
  protection (both marine and terrestrial) that have been fully implemented.
  "Blue-green growth" refers to strategies that promote sustainable use of ocean
  (blue) and land (green) resources while ensuring economic development.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which a country has implemented its
  national policies that are designed to support blue-green growth. These
  policies typically address issues such as marine conservation, sustainable
  fisheries, renewable energy, biodiversity protection, sustainable agriculture,
  and pollution control. The indicator provides insights into the country's
  commitment to and progress in achieving sustainable development goals through
  the integration of environmental and economic policies.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the implementation of blue-green growth-friendly policies is
  critical for assessing a country’s efforts to achieve sustainable development.
  Fully implementing these policies is essential for balancing economic growth
  with environmental sustainability, ensuring that natural resources are
  preserved for future generations. This indicator helps policymakers,
  stakeholders, and the public understand the effectiveness of government
  initiatives aimed at promoting sustainability, identify gaps in policy
  implementation, and guide future actions to enhance environmental stewardship
  while fostering economic growth.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of 'Blue-Green Growth Friendly' National Policies
  Fully Implemented," first identify and compile a list of all national policies
  that are classified as "blue-green growth friendly." Then, assess the
  implementation status of each policy to determine whether it has been fully
  implemented. Next, divide the number of fully implemented policies by the
  total number of such policies identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100
  to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Policies Fully Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented
  Blue-Green Growth Policies/Total Number of Identified Blue-Green Growth
  Policies) * 100
