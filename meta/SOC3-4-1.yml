  The "Percentage of Units with Current Strategic Plans in Place That Link with
  Health Sector Strategy" indicator measures the proportion of organizational
  units within the health sector that have developed and implemented strategic
  plans. These plans must be up-to-date and explicitly aligned with the
  overarching Health Sector Strategy to be included in this measure.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which organizational units within the
  health sector, such as hospitals, clinics, health departments, and other
  related entities, are operating under a strategic framework that is consistent
  with the broader Health Sector Strategy. Strategic plans guide the activities
  and priorities of these units, ensuring that their goals and actions
  contribute to the overall objectives of the health sector.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of units with current strategic plans that align
  with the Health Sector Strategy is crucial for ensuring coherence and
  coordination across the health sector. Strategic plans help to align the
  resources, actions, and goals of individual units with the sector-wide
  priorities and strategies, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
  health services.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Units with Current Strategic Plans in Place That
  Link with Health Sector Strategy," first identify and list all relevant units
  within the health sector. Then, collect data on how many of these units have
  current strategic plans that are aligned with the Health Sector Strategy.
  Next, divide the number of units with aligned strategic plans by the total
  number of units. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion
  as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Units with Aligned Strategic Plans (%) = (Number of Units with
  Current, Aligned Strategic Plans/Total Number of Units Assessed) * 100
