Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Public Schools Using the Culture and Heritage Modules in
  National Curriculum at All Levels" indicator measures the percentage of public
  schools that have integrated and are actively using culture and heritage
  modules within their curriculum across all grade levels. These modules focus
  on educating students about the cultural history, traditions, and heritage of
  their country or region.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption and implementation of educational content
  that promotes cultural awareness and preservation within the public school
  system. The culture and heritage modules are designed to help students
  understand and appreciate their cultural identity, heritage, and the diverse
  traditions that shape their society. The indicator reflects the extent to
  which these important topics are being taught in schools, ensuring that
  cultural education is a core component of the national curriculum.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of public schools using culture and heritage modules
  is essential for assessing the effectiveness of efforts to integrate cultural
  education into the national curriculum. Teaching students about their cultural
  heritage is key to fostering a sense of identity, pride, and continuity within
  communities. It also supports the preservation of cultural knowledge and
  practices that might otherwise be at risk of being forgotten.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Public Schools Using the Culture and Heritage
  Modules in National Curriculum at All Levels," first identify all public
  schools within the educational system. Verify whether each school has
  integrated culture and heritage modules into their curriculum at all levels by
  reviewing relevant school and curriculum documents. Calculate the proportion
  by dividing the number of schools using the modules by the total number of
  public schools, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Schools Using Culture and Heritage Modules (%) = (Number of
  Schools Using Culture and Heritage Modules/Total Number of Public Schools) *
  100
