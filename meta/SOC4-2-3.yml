Definition: >-
  The "Percentage of Reported Cases of Violence Against Women, Children, and
  Vulnerable People Addressed" indicator measures the proportion of officially
  reported cases of violence against women, children, and vulnerable individuals
  that have been effectively addressed. Addressing a case involves taking
  appropriate actions, such as investigation, legal proceedings, provision of
  support services, or resolution, within a specified period.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the responsiveness of law enforcement, social services,
  and other relevant agencies in handling cases of violence against women,
  children, and vulnerable populations. Addressing a case means not only
  initiating an investigation but also providing necessary support services
  (e.g., counselling, legal aid, medical care) and ensuring that justice and
  protection are delivered to the victims. The indicator reflects the efficiency
  and effectiveness of the system in responding to reports of violence and in
  protecting vulnerable individuals.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of reported cases of violence that are addressed is
  crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the justice system, social
  services, and protection mechanisms in safeguarding vulnerable populations. A
  high percentage indicates that reported cases are being actively managed and
  resolved, which is essential for maintaining public trust in the system and
  for ensuring the safety and well-being of victims. Conversely, a low
  percentage may indicate systemic challenges such as under-resourcing, lack of
  capacity, or barriers to accessing justice and support.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Percentage of Reported Cases of Violence Against Women,
  Children, and Vulnerable People Addressed," first collect data on the total
  number of reported cases within a specified period. Then, gather data on how
  many of these cases have been addressed through actions such as investigation,
  legal proceedings, or support services. Next, divide the number of addressed
  cases by the total number of reported cases, and multiply the result by 100 to
  express the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Reported Cases Addressed (%) = (Number of Cases Addressed/Total
  Number of Reported Cases) * 100
