  Monitoring the proportion of cultural heritage materials in the national
  curriculum is essential for assessing the effectiveness of educational
  policies aimed at preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge.
  Incorporating cultural heritage into the curriculum helps foster a sense of

MethodOfComputation: >2
   To compute the "Proportion of Cultural Heritage Materials in the National Curriculum at All Levels," first review the national curriculum to identify the presence of cultural heritage content across all educational levels. Quantify this content by calculating the percentage of curriculum dedicated to cultural heritage topics relative to the total curriculum content. Calculate the proportion by dividing the cultural heritage content by the total curriculum content, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Cultural Heritage Materials (% )= (Total Content on Cultural
  Heritage in Curriculum/Total Curriculum Content) * 100
