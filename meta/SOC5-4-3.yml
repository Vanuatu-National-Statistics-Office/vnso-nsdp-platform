Definition: >-
  The "Level of Reporting to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)" indicator
  measures the extent to which vessels, particularly fishing and commercial
  vessels, comply with reporting requirements by regularly transmitting their
  location, activities, and other relevant data to the Vessel Monitoring System.
  The VMS is a satellite-based system used to monitor the movements and
  activities of vessels to ensure compliance with fishing regulations, maritime
  safety, and environmental protection standards.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adherence of vessels to reporting protocols as part
  of the Vessel Monitoring System. VMS is crucial for real-time tracking and
  management of maritime activities, allowing authorities to monitor fishing
  efforts, detect illegal activities, and ensure vessels operate within
  designated areas and comply with international and national regulations. The
  level of reporting can reflect the effectiveness of monitoring systems and the
  willingness or ability of vessel operators to comply with regulatory
  requirements.
Disaggregation: Vessel type
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the level of reporting to VMS helps to evaluate the effectiveness
  of maritime surveillance and the compliance of fishing vessels with reporting
  requirements. High levels of reporting indicate strong adherence to
  regulations and effective monitoring of fishing activities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Monitoring the level of reporting to the VMS is essential for assessing the
  effectiveness of maritime governance and the enforcement of fisheries
  management regulations. High levels of reporting indicate robust compliance,
  which supports sustainable fisheries management, maritime safety, and
  environmental protection. Conversely, low levels of reporting may signal
  non-compliance, technical issues, or gaps in the monitoring system,
  potentially leading to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activities.

  Reporting Level (%) = (Number of Vessels Compliant with Reporting
  Requirements/Total Number of Vessels Required to Report) * 100
