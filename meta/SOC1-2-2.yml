  The "Proportion of Population Possessing Common and Basic Traditional
  Production Skills Related to Weaving, Transport, Housing, Farming, and Food
  Preparation" indicator measures the percentage of the population that has
  retained and can demonstrate basic traditional skills in areas such as
  weaving, traditional transport methods, construction of traditional housing,
  farming, and food preparation. These skills are typically passed down through
  generations and are essential for maintaining cultural practices and
  self-sufficiency within a community.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the preservation and transmission of traditional
  knowledge and skills that are fundamental to daily life in many communities.
  Traditional production skills, such as weaving, building, farming, and food
  preparation, are not only practical but also carry cultural significance. They
  reflect a community's history, resourcefulness, and relationship with the
  environment. The indicator provides insight into the extent to which these
  essential skills are retained within a population, which is crucial for
  cultural continuity and resilience.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population that possesses basic traditional
  production skills is essential for assessing the vitality of cultural heritage
  and the capacity for self-sufficiency within communities. As modern
  technologies and lifestyles increasingly replace traditional methods, these
  skills may be at risk of being lost.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Proportion of Population Possessing Common and Basic
  Traditional Production Skills Related to Weaving, Transport, Housing, Farming,
  Food Preparation," first collect data through surveys or census to assess
  individuals' proficiency in these traditional skills. Identify the number of
  respondents who possess and can demonstrate these skills. Calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of skilled individuals by the total
  population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Traditional Skills (%) = (Number of Individuals
  with Traditional Production Skills/Total Population Surveyed) * 100
