  The "Number of Environmental Guidelines Developed" indicator measures the
  total count of formal environmental guidelines that have been created within a
  specific period. These guidelines provide frameworks, best practices, and
  standards for managing environmental issues, ensuring sustainable development,
  and mitigating the impact of various activities on the environment.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the development of environmental guidelines, which are
  essential tools for guiding policymakers, businesses, and communities in
  environmental management. These guidelines typically cover a range of
  environmental topics such as waste management, pollution control, biodiversity
  conservation, sustainable resource use, and climate change adaptation. The
  indicator reflects efforts to strengthen environmental governance and promote
  sustainability by providing clear, actionable guidance for various
  stakeholders.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of environmental guidelines developed is crucial for
  assessing the progress of environmental policy and governance. Well-developed
  guidelines are vital for standardizing environmental practices, reducing
  environmental harm, and ensuring compliance with national and international
  environmental regulations. They help in translating broad environmental
  policies into specific actions that can be implemented by industries,
  governments, and communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Environmental Guidelines Developed," first gather
  data on all environmental guidelines created within the specified period from
  government agencies, environmental organizations, or relevant regulatory
  bodies. Then, verify that these guidelines are officially recognized, formally
  documented, and aimed at addressing specific environmental issues or promoting
  sustainable practices. Finally, count the total number of guidelines that meet
  these criteria within the specified time frame.


  Formula:

  Number of Environmental Guidelines Developed= Total Developed and Approved
  Environmental Guidelines
