  The "Average Travelling Distance to the Nearest School, Health Facility,
  Police Post by Provinces" indicator measures the average distance that
  residents in each province must travel to reach the nearest essential public
  services, including schools, health facilities, and police posts. This
  indicator provides a snapshot of the accessibility of these critical services
  across different regions.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the accessibility of essential public
  services—education, healthcare, and law enforcement—by measuring the average
  distance residents must travel to access them. Accessibility to these services
  is a key determinant of the quality of life and overall well-being of a
  population. Longer distances can indicate challenges in service provision and
  may highlight the need for improved infrastructure or additional service
  points in certain areas. The indicator is disaggregated by province to provide
  a regional analysis of service accessibility.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the average travelling distance to the nearest school, health
  facility, and police post is crucial for understanding disparities in service
  access and identifying areas where infrastructure or service provision needs
  to be improved. Shorter distances generally indicate better access to
  essential services, which can lead to improved educational outcomes, better
  health, and enhanced security for the population. Conversely, longer distances
  can pose significant barriers to accessing these services, particularly in
  rural or remote areas.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Average Travelling Distance to the Nearest School, Health
  Facility, Police Post by Provinces," first collect data on the locations of
  these services and the distribution of the population within each province.
  Then, measure the distance from each residential area or population point to
  the nearest school, health facility, or police post. Sum these distances for
  all areas within the province and divide by the total number of areas or
  population points considered to calculate the average distance. This process
  should be repeated separately for each type of service (school, health
  facility, and police post) to obtain the average distance for each service by
  province.


  Formula

  Average Distance to Nearest Service (Province X)= (Total Distance from
  Residential Area to Nearest Service in Province X/Number of Residential Areas
  or Household Points in Province X)
