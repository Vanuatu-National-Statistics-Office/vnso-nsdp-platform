Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of the population with access to broadband
  connection is crucial for assessing progress in bridging the digital divide
  and ensuring that all segments of the population can benefit from the digital
  economy. Broadband access is a key driver of economic growth, social
  inclusion, and innovation. It enables businesses to reach new markets,
  students to access online education, and individuals to connect with others
  and access essential services.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage (%) of Population Having Access to Broadband
  Connection," first collect data on the number of individuals or households
  with access to broadband internet and obtain the total population for the same
  period. Then, calculate the percentage by dividing the number of those with
  broadband access by the total population and multiplying by 100 to express the
  result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Population with Broadband Access= (Number of Individuals with
  Broadband Access/Total Population)*100
