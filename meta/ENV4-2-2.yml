  The "Establishment of GIS Mapping Relevant to the Management of Forest
  Activities" indicator measures the progress made in developing and
  implementing Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping tools and databases
  specifically designed to support the management, monitoring, and planning of
  forest activities. This includes the creation of maps that detail forest
  cover, land use, biodiversity, deforestation rates, reforestation efforts, and
  other forest-related data.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the development and application of GIS technology to
  improve the management of forest resources. GIS mapping provides spatial data
  that is crucial for effective decision-making in forestry management, enabling
  stakeholders to visualize and analyze various aspects of forest ecosystems.
  The indicator reflects efforts to integrate advanced technology into forest
  management practices, ensuring that forest activities are sustainable,
  transparent, and based on accurate, up-to-date information.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the establishment of GIS mapping relevant to forest management is
  essential for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of forest
  conservation and resource utilization efforts. GIS mapping allows for better
  planning and monitoring of forest activities, such as logging, conservation,
  reforestation, and habitat protection. It helps forest managers, policymakers,
  and environmental organizations to make informed decisions, identify areas at
  risk, plan sustainable harvesting, and track changes in forest cover over
  time.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Establishment of GIS Mapping Relevant to the Management of
  Forest Activities," first identify and list all GIS mapping projects developed
  specifically for forest management. Then, verify that these projects include
  relevant data layers and tools that are actively used or planned for use in
  managing forest activities. Next, assess the status of these GIS tools to
  determine whether they are fully developed and operational. Finally, document
  the progress made in establishing and integrating these GIS tools into forest
  management practices.
