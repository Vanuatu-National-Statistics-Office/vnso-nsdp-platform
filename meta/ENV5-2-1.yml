  The "Total Number of Registered Community Conservation Areas (CCAs)" indicator
  measures the total count of officially recognized and registered areas where
  local communities have established conservation practices to protect and
  manage natural resources and biodiversity. These areas are typically managed
  by local communities with the aim of preserving ecosystems, cultural heritage,
  and sustainable livelihoods.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the establishment and formal recognition of Community
  Conservation Areas (CCAs), which are areas designated by local communities to
  conserve natural resources, biodiversity, and cultural values. CCAs are a
  critical component of community-led conservation efforts, where local
  stakeholders play a central role in the management and protection of natural
  resources. These areas may include forests, wetlands, coastal zones, and other
  ecosystems that are significant for both ecological and cultural reasons.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of registered CCAs is essential for understanding
  the extent of community engagement in conservation efforts and the
  effectiveness of decentralized environmental governance. CCAs empower local
  communities to take charge of the conservation and sustainable use of their
  natural resources, often leading to more effective and culturally appropriate
  conservation outcomes.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Registered Community Conservation Areas
  (CCAs)," first identify and list all CCAs that have been formally registered
  with relevant authorities within the specified region or country. Then, verify
  that each CCA is officially registered and recognized by the appropriate
  authorities. Finally, count the total number of CCAs that have been verified
  as registered and officially recognized.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Registered CCAs = Sum of All Verified Registered Community
  Conservation Areas
