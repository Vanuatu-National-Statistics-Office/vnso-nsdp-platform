  The "Total Number of Cases with Children Experiencing Human Rights Violations
  in the Following Areas: Sexual Abuse, Neglect, Physical Abuse, Exploitation,
  Emotional Abuse (Disseminate by These Areas) Accessing Support Services"
  indicator measures the total count of cases where children who have
  experienced specific types of human rights violations—namely sexual abuse,
  neglect, physical abuse, exploitation, or emotional abuse—have accessed
  support services. The data is disaggregated by the type of abuse to provide
  detailed insights into the areas of violation.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the responsiveness of support systems to children who
  have experienced human rights violations, particularly in the areas of abuse
  and exploitation. Support services may include medical care, psychological
  counselling, legal aid, child protective services, shelter, and rehabilitation
  programs. By disaggregating data by type of abuse, the indicator provides a
  clearer understanding of the nature and extent of violations children face and
  the availability and utilization of services to support them.
Disaggregation: 'Type of human rights violation '
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of cases with children experiencing human rights
  violations who access support services is critical for evaluating the
  effectiveness of child protection systems. High numbers of children accessing
  support services can indicate awareness and availability of these services,
  while low numbers may suggest barriers to access, underreporting, or gaps in
  service provision. Disaggregating the data by type of abuse helps identify
  specific areas where additional resources or targeted interventions are
  needed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Cases with Children Experiencing Human Rights
  Violations in the Following Areas: Sexual Abuse, Neglect, Physical Abuse,
  Exploitation, Emotional Abuse Accessing Support Services," first identify and
  classify all reported cases where children have experienced these specific
  types of violations. Then, collect data on the number of these cases where
  children have accessed support services. Disaggregate the data by each type of
  violation to determine the number of cases in each category that have accessed
  services. Finally, sum the totals to provide the overall number of cases,
  disaggregated by the type of abuse.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Cases Accessing Support Services = Sum of All (Cases of Sexual
  Abuse + Cases of Neglect + Cases of Physical Abuse + Cases of Exploitation +
  Cases of Emotional Abuse)
