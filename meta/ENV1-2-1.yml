  The "National Food Guidelines Directing Food Security and Nutrition
  Promotional Activities (Including Aelan Kaikai) Completed and Operational"
  indicator measures whether a set of national guidelines has been developed,
  finalized, and implemented to guide food security and nutrition promotional
  activities. These guidelines encompass recommendations and strategies for
  improving food security, enhancing nutrition, and promoting traditional diets,
  including initiatives such as "Aelan Kaikai" (traditional island food).
Concept: >-
  This indicator assesses the existence and implementation of comprehensive
  national food guidelines that provide a framework for addressing food security
  and nutrition issues at a national level. The guidelines are intended to
  direct activities, programs, and policies that promote healthy eating, food
  security, and the preservation of traditional diets. The term "operational"
  refers to the guidelines being actively used to influence policy decisions,
  public health campaigns, and community initiatives. The inclusion of "aelan
  kaikai" emphasizes the importance of preserving and promoting traditional
  diets as part of a broader strategy to improve nutritional outcomes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the completion and operational status of national food guidelines
  is crucial for ensuring that a country has a coherent and actionable framework
  to address food security and nutrition issues. Such guidelines are essential
  for coordinating efforts across sectors to improve public health, reduce
  malnutrition, and promote sustainable food systems. The inclusion of
  traditional foods like "aelan kaikai" highlights the cultural and nutritional
  significance of local food practices.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the percentage of "National Food Guidelines Directing Food Security
  and Nutrition Promotional Activities (Including Aelan Kaikai) Completed and
  Operational," first determine the total number of relevant guidelines. Then,
  count the number of these guidelines that are both completed and actively
  operational. Finally, calculate the percentage by dividing the number of
  completed and operational guidelines by the total number of relevant
  guidelines, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula

  Percentage of Completed and Operational Guidelines (%) = (Number of Completed
  and Operational Guidelines/Total Number of Relevant Guidelines) * 100
