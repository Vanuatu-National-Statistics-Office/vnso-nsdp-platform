  This indicator tracks the certification and registration status of technical
  and vocational schools, which are essential for providing students with
  practical skills and knowledge relevant to the job market. The Vanuatu
  Qualifications Authority is responsible for setting and enforcing standards
  for educational institutions to ensure that they deliver accredited programs
  that align with national qualifications frameworks. Certification and
  registration by the VQA indicate that a school is recognized as meeting the
  quality standards necessary for operating and delivering vocational education.

  institutions operating in Vanuatu. Then, verify whether each school has been
  certified and registered by the Vanuatu Qualifications Authority (VQA).
  Finally, count the total number of schools that have successfully obtained
  certification and registration from the VQA.
