Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Registered Hospitality Institutions with Rooms and Services
  Equipped with Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliances" indicator measures the
  percentage of hospitality institutions, such as hotels, resorts, and
  guesthouses, that have implemented energy-efficient lighting and appliances in
  their rooms and service areas. This includes the use of LED lighting,
  energy-saving air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other appliances
  designed to reduce energy consumption.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption of energy-efficient technologies within the
  hospitality sector, focusing on the extent to which registered hospitality
  institutions are incorporating sustainable practices in their operations.
  Energy-efficient lighting and appliances help reduce the environmental
  footprint of hospitality services by lowering energy consumption, reducing
  greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting operational costs. The indicator
  provides insights into the sector’s commitment to sustainability and energy
  conservation.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of hospitality institutions equipped with
  energy-efficient lighting and appliances is crucial for assessing progress
  toward sustainability goals in the tourism and hospitality industry. Energy
  efficiency in hospitality not only reduces operational costs but also aligns
  with global and national efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing energy
  consumption and carbon emissions. A higher proportion indicates a stronger
  commitment to sustainability, potentially attracting environmentally conscious
  travelers and enhancing the industry's overall reputation.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Registered Hospitality Institutions with Rooms
  and Services Equipped with Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliances," first
  collect data on the total number of registered hospitality institutions and
  the number of those that have implemented energy-efficient technologies.
  Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of energy-efficient
  institutions by the total number of registered institutions, and multiply by
  100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Energy-Efficient Institutions (%) = (Number of Institutions with
  Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliances/Total Number of Registered
  Hospitality Institutions)*100
