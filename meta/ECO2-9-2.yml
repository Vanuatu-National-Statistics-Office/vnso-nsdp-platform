  The "Annual Change in Total Number of Users of Online Government Services"
  indicator measures the year-over-year percentage change in the total number of
  individuals who access and use government services through online platforms.
  This includes a wide range of digital services provided by government
  agencies, such as applying for permits, accessing public records, paying
  taxes, or receiving social services online.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the growth or decline in the use of online government
  services, reflecting the adoption of digital technologies by the population
  and the effectiveness of government efforts to provide services through
  digital platforms. The indicator focuses on the shift towards e-government,
  where government services are increasingly delivered online to improve
  accessibility, efficiency, and convenience for citizens.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the annual change in the number of users of online government
  services is crucial for understanding the progress of digital transformation
  within the public sector. A positive change indicates that more citizens are
  accessing government services online, which can lead to greater efficiency,
  cost savings, and improved service delivery. It also suggests that digital
  inclusion efforts are succeeding, with more people gaining the skills and
  access needed to use online services. Conversely, a negative change could
  signal barriers to access, such as inadequate digital infrastructure, low
  digital literacy, or dissatisfaction with the services provided.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Annual Change in Total Number of Users of Online Government
  Services," first collect data on the total number of unique users who accessed
  online government services during the current and previous years. Calculate
  the change by subtracting the previous year’s total from the current year’s
  total. Then, divide the change by the previous year’s total and multiply by
  100 to express the result as a percentage, representing the annual growth or
  decline in the number of users.


  Formula:

  Annual Change in Users (%) = ((Total Users in Current Year – Total Users in
  Previous Year)/Total Users in Previous Year)*100
