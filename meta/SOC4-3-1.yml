  The "Proportion of Population Reporting Some Degree of Disability" indicator
  measures the percentage of individuals within a population who self-report
  experiencing some form of disability. Disabilities can be physical, sensory,
  cognitive, or psychosocial and can range from mild to severe. The indicator
  typically encompasses both temporary and permanent disabilities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of disability within a population,
  providing insight into the proportion of individuals who experience
  limitations in functioning due to physical, mental, sensory, or emotional
  conditions. Disabilities can affect various aspects of life, including
  mobility, communication, self-care, and participation in work or social
  activities. Understanding the proportion of the population with disabilities
  helps in identifying the scale of need for accessible services, support, and
  policies aimed at inclusion.
Disaggregation: 'Region, Sex'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population reporting some degree of
  disability is crucial for developing and implementing policies and programs
  that promote accessibility, inclusion, and equality. It also supports the
  assessment of compliance with international commitments, such as the
  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and national
  policies aimed at improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Proportion of Population Reporting Some Degree of Disability,"
  first design and administer a survey that includes questions about various
  types of disabilities. Then, identify the individuals who report having some
  degree of disability based on their responses. Next, divide the number of
  individuals reporting disabilities by the total number of respondents in the
  survey. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population Reporting Disability (%) = (Number of Individuals
  Reporting Disability/Total Population) * 100
