  The "Percentage of Public Buildings and Banking, Employment, and Recreational
  Facilities Allowing Access for People with Disabilities" indicator measures
  the proportion of public and commercial facilities, such as government
  buildings, banks, workplaces, and recreational venues, that are accessible to
  people with disabilities. Accessibility is defined by the presence of features
  such as ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms, and other accommodations that
  enable individuals with physical, sensory, or cognitive impairments to use
  these facilities independently.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the level of physical accessibility of public and
  commercial facilities for people with disabilities. Accessibility is a key
  component of inclusivity, ensuring that individuals with disabilities can
  participate fully in social, economic, and recreational activities. The
  indicator reflects the extent to which public and private sectors are
  complying with regulations and standards aimed at providing equal access to
  all members of society, including those with disabilities.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of accessible buildings and facilities is crucial
  for assessing progress toward inclusive environments that support the
  participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of life. High levels
  of accessibility indicate that physical barriers to participation are being
  addressed, contributing to greater independence, equality, and quality of life
  for people with disabilities. Conversely, low accessibility rates may
  highlight areas where additional efforts are needed to enforce accessibility
  standards and promote the rights of people with disabilities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Public Buildings and Banking, Employment, and
  Recreational Facilities Allowing Access for People with Disabilities," first
  identify and list all relevant facilities within the specified area. Then,
  assess each facility for the presence of accessibility features that enable
  use by people with disabilities. Next, collect data on the number of
  facilities that meet the accessibility criteria and divide this by the total
  number of facilities assessed. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express
  the proportion of accessible facilities as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Accessible Facilities (%) = (Number of Accessible
  Facilities/Total Number of Facilities assessed) * 100
