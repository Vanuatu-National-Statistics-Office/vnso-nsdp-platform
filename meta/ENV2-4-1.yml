Definition: >-
  The "Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities" indicator measures the
  total count of waste disposal sites that are managed and regulated according
  to specific environmental and safety standards. These facilities are designed
  to handle various types of waste in a manner that minimizes environmental
  impact, prevents contamination, and protects public health.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the availability and distribution of waste disposal
  facilities that operate under controlled conditions. Controlled waste disposal
  facilities include sanitary landfills, incinerators, and specialized treatment
  plants that adhere to established guidelines for the safe and environmentally
  sound management of waste. The indicator reflects the infrastructure in place
  to manage waste in a manner that complies with legal and environmental
  regulations, ensuring that waste is processed, treated, and disposed of
  safely.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of controlled waste disposal facilities is essential for
  understanding a country's capacity to manage waste effectively and
  sustainably. Controlled facilities are critical for preventing environmental
  pollution, protecting public health, and ensuring that waste is managed in a
  way that minimizes its impact on the environment.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities," first gather
  data on all waste disposal facilities within the region or country from
  environmental agencies, local authorities, or waste management companies.
  Then, verify that each facility is operational and complies with environmental
  regulations and safety standards. Finally, count the total number of
  facilities that meet the criteria for being classified as controlled waste
  disposal facilities.


  Formula:

  Number of Controlled Waste Disposal Facilities= Total Verified Controlled
  Waste Disposal Facilities
