  The "Proportion of Community Management Committees Implementing Their
  Community Conservation Area (CCA) Management Plan" indicator measures the
  percentage of community management committees that are actively implementing
  the management plans developed for their respective Community Conservation
  Areas (CCAs). This includes carrying out the conservation activities,
  monitoring, enforcement, and other actions outlined in the management plan to
  protect and manage the CCA.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness of community-led conservation efforts
  by assessing the extent to which management plans for CCAs are being put into
  action. A CCA management plan typically includes strategies for biodiversity
  conservation, sustainable resource use, habitat restoration, and community
  involvement. The implementation of these plans is crucial for achieving the
  conservation objectives set by the community and ensuring the long-term
  sustainability of the CCA.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of community management committees that are
  implementing their CCA management plans is essential for evaluating the
  success of community-based conservation initiatives. Effective implementation
  of these plans is a key indicator of the community’s commitment to
  conservation and the capacity of the management committee to oversee and
  execute conservation activities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Community Management Committees Implementing
  Their Community Conservation Area (CCA) Management Plan," first identify all
  community management committees that have established a management plan for
  their CCAs. Assess the implementation status of each plan by reviewing
  relevant reports and documentation. Calculate the proportion by dividing the
  number of committees actively implementing their plans by the total number of
  committees with management plans, and multiply by 100 to express the result as
  a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Committees Implementing Their Plans (%) = (Number of Committees
  Implementing Their Plans/Total Number of Committees with Management Plans) *
  100
