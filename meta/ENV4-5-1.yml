  The "Total Number of Approved Fisheries Management Plans for Designated
  Fisheries" indicator measures the total count of fisheries management plans
  that have been formally approved and are in place for specific, designated
  fisheries. These management plans are comprehensive documents that outline
  strategies, regulations, and measures aimed at ensuring the sustainable use
  and conservation of fishery resources.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the development and formal approval of Fisheries
  Management Plans (FMPs) that are designed to guide the sustainable management
  of specific fisheries. An FMP typically includes regulations on fishing
  methods, quotas, seasons, habitat protection, monitoring, and enforcement
  mechanisms. The plans are essential tools for preventing overfishing,
  protecting marine ecosystems, and ensuring that fishery resources are managed
  in a way that balances ecological health with economic and social benefits.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of approved Fisheries Management Plans is critical
  for assessing the effectiveness of fisheries governance and the commitment to
  sustainable fisheries management. FMPs play a vital role in conserving fish
  stocks, protecting marine habitats, and ensuring that fishing practices are
  sustainable in the long term.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Approved Fisheries Management Plans for
  Designated Fisheries," first identify all designated fisheries for which
  Fisheries Management Plans are required or have been developed. Verify that
  these plans have been formally approved by reviewing official records and
  documentation. Then, count the total number of approved plans for the
  designated fisheries within the reporting period.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Approved FMPs = Sum of All Verified Approved Fisheries
