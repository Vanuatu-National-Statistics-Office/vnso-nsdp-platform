  The "Proportion of Data Collected from Requests Acted Upon by Right to
  Information (RTI) Officers in Each Government Agency" indicator measures the
  percentage of requests for information received by RTI officers in government
  agencies that have been successfully processed and acted upon. This includes
  providing the requested information or taking appropriate action as stipulated
  by the Right to Information legislation.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness and responsiveness of government
  agencies in handling requests for information submitted under Right to
  Information (RTI) laws. The RTI laws are designed to promote transparency and
  accountability in governance by granting citizens the right to access
  information held by public authorities. The role of RTI officers is to process
  these requests and ensure that citizens receive the information they are
  entitled to in a timely manner.
Disaggregation: Government Agency
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of data requests acted upon by RTI officers is
  crucial for assessing the implementation of RTI laws and the level of
  transparency in government agencies. A high proportion of requests acted upon
  indicates that government agencies are effectively upholding citizens' right
  to information, contributing to greater transparency and accountability.
  Conversely, a low proportion may suggest challenges in the processing of RTI
  requests, such as delays, resource constraints, or non-compliance with RTI
  legislation.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Data Collected from Requests Acted Upon by Right
  to Information (RTI) Officers in Each Government Agency," first collect data
  on the total number of RTI requests received by each government agency within
  a specified period. Then, collect data on the number of these requests that
  were successfully processed and acted upon by the RTI officers. Divide the
  number of requests acted upon by the total number of requests received, and
  multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Acted Upon RTI Requests (%) = (Number of RTI Requests Acted
  Upon/Total Number of RTI Requests Received) * 100
