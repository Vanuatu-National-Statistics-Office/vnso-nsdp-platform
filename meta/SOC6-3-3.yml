  Monitoring the number of MPs submitting annual financial accountability
  reports is essential for assessing the level of transparency and
  accountability in the legislative branch. High compliance rates indicate that
  MPs are adhering to their legal obligations, contributing to public trust in
  the integrity of elected officials. Conversely, low compliance rates may
  suggest governance challenges, potential risks of corruption, or a lack of
  enforcement of accountability mechanisms.

  Report," first identify and list all MPs who are required to submit these
  reports according to legal or parliamentary regulations. Then, collect data on
  how many MPs have submitted their reports within the specified reporting
  period. Finally, count the total number of MPs who have successfully submitted
  their financial accountability reports to determine the indicator value.
