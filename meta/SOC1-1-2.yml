  The "Proportion of Population Whose First Language Learned is Indigenous"
  indicator measures the percentage of the population that learned an indigenous
  language as their first language, often referred to as a mother tongue. An
  indigenous language is a language native to a particular region or community,
  traditionally spoken by the indigenous peoples of that area.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which indigenous languages are passed down
  as the first language to new generations within a population. The first
  language learned by an individual plays a crucial role in shaping their
  cultural identity, cognitive development, and linguistic proficiency. The
  indicator provides insight into the intergenerational transmission of
  indigenous languages, which is key to preserving linguistic diversity and
  cultural heritage.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population that learned an indigenous
  language as their first language is essential for assessing the vitality of
  these languages within a community. A higher proportion indicates strong
  cultural continuity and effective transmission of indigenous languages from
  one generation to the next. Conversely, a declining proportion may signal
  language shift, where dominant languages replace indigenous ones as the
  primary language of communication.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population Whose First Language Learned is
  Indigenous," first collect data on the first language learned by individuals
  through surveys or census, asking respondents to identify the language they
  first learned to speak as a child. Identify the number of individuals who
  report an indigenous language as their first language. Calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of indigenous first language learners by the
  total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a
  percentage.


  **Formula**:

  Proportion of Indigenous First Language Learners (%) = (Number of Indigenous
  First Language Learners/ Total Population Surveyed) *100
