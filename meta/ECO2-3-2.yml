Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Existing Buildings Repaired in Compliance with the Building
  Code" indicator measures the percentage of existing buildings that, when
  repaired or renovated, adhere to the standards and regulations set forth in
  the local or national building code. Compliance with the building code ensures
  that repaired buildings meet safety, structural integrity, and health
  standards
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the compliance of repairs and renovations on existing
  buildings with the established building codes. Building codes define the
  minimum standards for construction, including safety, structural soundness,
  fire safety, electrical and plumbing systems, and accessibility. When
  buildings are repaired or renovated, it is essential that these updates comply
  with the relevant building codes to ensure the continued safety and
  functionality of the structure. This indicator provides insight into how well
  existing buildings are maintained according to safety standards during repair
  and renovation activities.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of existing buildings repaired in compliance with
  the building code is crucial for public safety and the long-term resilience of
  the built environment. Non-compliant repairs can compromise the structural
  integrity and safety of buildings, leading to potential hazards such as
  collapses, fires, or other dangerous situations. Ensuring that repairs meet
  building code standards helps to protect occupants, extend the lifespan of
  buildings, and maintain the overall safety and sustainability of the urban and
  rural infrastructure.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Existing Buildings Repaired in Compliance with
  the Building Code," first collect data from building inspections to determine
  the number of buildings with repairs or renovations that comply with the
  building code. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing the number of
  compliant repaired buildings by the total number of repaired buildings
  inspected, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Repaired Buildings in Compliance= (Number of Compliant Repaired
  Buildings/Total Number of Repaired Buildings Inspected)*100
