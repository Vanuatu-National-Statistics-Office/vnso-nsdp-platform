Definition: >-
  The indicator “Donor Funds Allocated to Government by Ministry” tracks the
  total value of donor funding allocated directly to government ministries for a
  given year. It includes all external assistance channelled through government
  systems, whether as project-specific grants or general budget support.
Concept: >-
  This indicator is based on the concept of external development financing
  aligned with national systems. Donor funds are a critical complement to
  domestic budgets in many developing countries, particularly for achieving
  development goals. Tracking these allocations helps assess the degree of donor
  alignment with government plans, the extent of external resource mobilisation,
  and the effectiveness of aid coordination.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring donor funds allocated to government ministries is essential for
  understanding the scale and focus of external support. It highlights which
  sectors receive donor investments and whether those funds are being integrated
  into national plans and systems. High reliance on donor funding in key sectors
  may indicate strategic partnerships, but it can also raise issues of
  sustainability and dependency.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Aggregate the total value of donor contributions recorded under each ministry
  for the reference year. Data should reflect actual commitments or
  disbursements made through the government budget framework, either as
  stand-alone projects or pooled funding.


  Formula: 

  Donor Funds Allocated to Ministry (M, year Y) = ∑ Donor Contributions recorded
  for Ministry M in year Y
