  The "Up-to-Date Data on Primary Production (Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry,
  Fisheries, Biosecurity) Available for Analysis and Informed Decision-Making
  and Reporting" indicator measures the availability and timeliness of accurate,
  comprehensive, and current data related to primary production sectors such as
  agriculture, livestock, forestry, fisheries, and biosecurity. This data is
  crucial for effective analysis, decision-making, and reporting at both the
  national and regional levels.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the accessibility and relevance of data related to
  primary production sectors. Primary production data includes statistics and
  information on crop yields, livestock populations, forest resources, fish
  catches, and biosecurity measures, among others. Having up-to-date and
  reliable data is essential for monitoring sector performance, assessing
  trends, making informed policy decisions, and ensuring sustainable management
  of natural resources. The indicator reflects the capacity of a country or
  region to collect, maintain, and disseminate this data regularly.
Disaggregation: Sector & Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the availability of up-to-date data on primary production is
  critical for effective governance, policy formulation, and sustainable
  development. Reliable data enables governments and stakeholders to make
  informed decisions that can improve agricultural productivity, enhance food
  security, manage natural resources sustainably, and respond to environmental
  challenges. Without accurate and current data, decisions may be based on
  outdated or incomplete information, leading to inefficiencies, mismanagement,
  and missed opportunities.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Up-to-Date Data on Primary Production (Agriculture, Livestock,
  Forestry, Fisheries, Biosecurity) Available for Analysis and Informed
  Decision-Making and Reporting," first collect and assess the availability and
  timeliness of data across the primary production sectors. Then, evaluate the
  proportion of data sets that are up-to-date and readily available for analysis
  and decision-making. Calculate this proportion by dividing the number of
  up-to-date and available data sets by the total number of required data sets,
  and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Up to Date Data Available (%) = (Number of Primary Production
  Data Sets That Are Up to Date and Available/Number of Required Primary
  Production Data Sets) * 100
