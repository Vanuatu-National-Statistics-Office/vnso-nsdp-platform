Definition: >-
  The "Annual Change in Number of Magistrate and Supreme Court Pending Cases"
  indicator measures the difference in the total number of unresolved cases
  (pending cases) in the Magistrate and Supreme Courts at the end of a given
  year compared to the number of pending cases at the end of the previous year.
  This indicator reflects the year-over-year variation in the backlog of cases
  within the judicial system.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system
  in processing and resolving cases. A pending case is any legal matter that has
  been filed in court but has not yet reached a final judgment or resolution.
  The annual change in the number of pending cases can indicate whether the
  court system is becoming more efficient (reducing the backlog) or less
  efficient (increasing the backlog).

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the annual change in the number of pending cases is crucial for
  understanding the performance of the judiciary. A growing number of pending
  cases may indicate delays in the justice process, insufficient judicial
  resources, or other systemic issues that hinder the timely resolution of
  cases. Conversely, a reduction in pending cases suggests improvements in court
  efficiency, which is essential for ensuring timely access to justice.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Annual Change in Number of Magistrate and Supreme Court
  Pending Cases," first collect data on the total number of pending cases in
  both courts at the end of the current year and the previous year. Then,
  subtract the number of pending cases at the end of the previous year from the
  number at the end of the current year to determine the annual change. A
  positive result indicates an increase in the number of pending cases, while a
  negative result indicates a decrease.


  Formula:

  Annual Change in Pending Cases=Pending Cases at End of Current Year – Pending
  Cases at End of Previous Year

  Percentage Change in Pending Cases (%) = (Annual Change in Pending
  Cases/Pending Cases at End of Previous Year) * 100
