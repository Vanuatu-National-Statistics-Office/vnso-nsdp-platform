  The "Percentage of Aid to the Government Sector Reported on the Government’s
  Budget" indicator measures the proportion of total aid received by the
  government sector that is recorded in the national budget. This indicator
  reflects the extent to which aid is transparently incorporated into the
  government's financial planning and reporting processes.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the integration of external aid into the government's
  official budgetary framework. Aid to the government sector includes financial
  resources provided by external donors, including bilateral, multilateral, and
  international organizations, intended to support government programs and
  projects. Properly recording this aid in the government’s budget ensures that
  all resources are accounted for, enhances transparency, and allows for better
  alignment of aid with national priorities.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of aid reported on the government’s budget is
  crucial for assessing the transparency and accountability of government
  financial management. When aid is fully reported in the government’s budget,
  it indicates that there is a clear and transparent process for tracking
  external resources, which is essential for effective planning, monitoring, and
  evaluation of government expenditures. Conversely, a lower percentage may
  indicate gaps in financial reporting, challenges in aid coordination, or a
  lack of integration between donor funds and the government’s financial
  systems.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Aid to the Government Sector Reported on the
  Government’s Budget," first collect data on the total amount of aid received
  by the government sector during the reporting period. Then, collect data on
  the amount of aid that is officially recorded in the government’s budget for
  the same period. Divide the amount of aid reported in the budget by the total
  amount of aid received, and multiply the result by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Aid Reported on Budget (%) = (Aid Reported in the Government
  Budget/Total Aid Received by the Government Sector) * 100
