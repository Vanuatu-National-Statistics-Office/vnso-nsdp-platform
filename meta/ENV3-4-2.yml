  Awareness Programs Established Targeting Issues Such as Climate Change
  Adaptation and Resilience," first identify and list all relevant activities
  and programs established within the specified period. Then, verify that each
  activity or program specifically targets climate change adaptation and
  resilience. Finally, count the total number of verified activities and
  programs.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Communication and Partnership Activities and Awareness
  Programs Established = Sum of All Verified Activities and Programs Targeting
