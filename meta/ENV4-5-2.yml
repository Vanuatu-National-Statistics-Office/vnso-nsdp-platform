Definition: >-
  The "Number of Commercial Sand Mines" indicator measures the total count of
  sand mining operations that are conducted for commercial purposes within a
  specified region or country. These operations involve the extraction of sand
  from various environments, such as riverbeds, beaches, and dunes, for use in
  construction, manufacturing, and other industries.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the presence and growth of commercial sand mining
  activities, which are a significant part of the construction and industrial
  sectors. Sand is a critical resource used in concrete production, glass
  manufacturing, and other construction-related activities. The indicator
  reflects the extent of sand extraction operations and provides insights into
  the economic activities related to natural resource utilization.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of commercial sand mines is essential for understanding
  the scale of sand extraction and its potential environmental and
  socio-economic impacts. While sand mining is crucial for economic development,
  it can lead to environmental degradation, including habitat destruction,
  riverbed erosion, and coastal erosion, if not managed sustainably.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Commercial Sand Mines," first identify all active
  sand mines within the region or country by reviewing permits and licenses
  issued by regulatory agencies. Verify that these sand mines are commercially
  operated, meaning they extract sand for sale or industrial use. Then, count
  the total number of commercial sand mines that are operational within the
  reporting period.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Commercial Sand Mines = Sum of All Verified Commercial Sand
  Mines
