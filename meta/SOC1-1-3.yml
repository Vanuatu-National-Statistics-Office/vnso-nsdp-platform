Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Endangered Languages Documented" indicator measures the
  percentage of languages classified as endangered within a specific region or
  country that have been formally documented. Documentation includes the
  systematic recording of the language’s vocabulary, grammar, oral traditions,
  and other linguistic and cultural features, often in written, audio, or
  digital formats.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efforts to preserve endangered languages by
  documenting them before they potentially become extinct. Endangered languages
  are those at risk of falling out of use, typically because their speakers are
  declining in number, or they are shifting to more dominant languages.
  Documentation is a critical step in preserving the linguistic heritage,
  providing a resource for language revitalization, and ensuring that future
  generations have access to the language.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of endangered languages that have been documented is
  essential for evaluating the effectiveness of language preservation
  initiatives. Documentation is crucial for maintaining linguistic diversity and
  cultural heritage, as it captures the knowledge, history, and identity
  embedded in endangered languages.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Endangered Languages Documented," first identify
  and list all languages classified as endangered within the specified region or
  country. Then, verify whether each endangered language has been documented by
  checking for comprehensive records in written, audio, or digital formats.
  Next, divide the number of documented endangered languages by the total number
  of endangered languages identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to
  express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Endangered Languages Documented (%) = (Number of Documented
  Endangered Languages/Total Number of Endangered Languages) * 100
