  The "Labour Force Participation by Sector" indicator measures the proportion
  of the working-age population (usually aged 15 and above) that is actively
  engaged in the labour market, categorized by specific sectors of the economy,
  such as agriculture, industry, and services. This indicator provides insights
  into the distribution of labour across different sectors and reflects the
  level of economic activity within each sector.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the engagement of the labour force within different
  sectors of the economy, highlighting how the workforce is distributed across
  agriculture, industry, and services. Labour force participation refers to the
  percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively
  seeking employment. By analysing participation by sector, this indicator helps
  to understand the structure of the economy, the dominant sectors in terms of
  employment, and the shifts in labour force distribution over time, which can
  indicate economic development, industrialization, or sectoral changes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring labour force participation by sector is essential for understanding
  the dynamics of the labour market and the economy’s structure. A higher
  participation rate in a particular sector may indicate the sector’s
  significance to the economy and its capacity to generate employment.
  Conversely, a decline in participation in a sector may signal challenges such
  as declining profitability, technological changes, or shifts in market demand.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Labour Force Participation by Sector," first collect data on
  the number of individuals employed or actively seeking employment in each
  sector of the economy. Then, obtain the total labour force, including all
  sectors. Calculate the participation rate for each sector by dividing the
  number of individuals in that sector by the total labour force and multiplying
  by 100 to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Labour Force Participation Rate by Sector (%) = (Number of Individuals in
  Sector X/Total Labour Force) * 100
