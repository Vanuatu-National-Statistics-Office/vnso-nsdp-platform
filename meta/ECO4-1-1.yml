  The "Growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation" (GFCF) indicator measures the
  percentage change in the value of investments in fixed assets within an
  economy over a specific period, usually year-over-year. Fixed assets include
  infrastructure, machinery, equipment, and buildings that are used in the
  production of goods and services. This indicator reflects the level of
  investment in long-term assets that contribute to future economic
  productivity.
Concept: >-
  Gross Fixed Capital Formation represents the net increase in physical assets
  within an economy, excluding inventory changes. It is a critical component of
  gross domestic product (GDP) and is used to assess the level of investment in
  the economy. Growth in GFCF indicates the expansion of an economy's productive
  capacity, as more capital is being allocated to infrastructure, machinery, and
  other long-term assets that support economic growth. This indicator helps
  track how much of an economy’s resources are being devoted to investment in
  fixed capital, which is essential for sustaining and enhancing productivity.
Disaggregation: None
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation is essential for
  understanding the dynamics of economic development and the potential for
  future growth. High growth in GFCF suggests strong investor confidence and
  increased capacity for economic output, which can lead to job creation,
  technological advancements, and improved standards of living. Conversely, low
  or negative growth in GFCF may indicate economic stagnation or declining
  investment levels, which can hinder long-term economic growth.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation," first collect data
  on the value of Gross Fixed Capital Formation for the current and previous
  periods. Then, calculate the growth rate by subtracting the previous period’s
  GFCF from the current period’s GFCF, dividing the difference by the previous
  period’s GFCF, and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. This
  percentage reflects the change in investment in fixed assets within the
  economy.


  Formula:

  Growth in GFCF (%)= ((GFCF in Current Period – GFCF in Previous Period)/GFCF
  in Previous Period)*100
