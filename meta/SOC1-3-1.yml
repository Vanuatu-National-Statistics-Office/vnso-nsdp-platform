  The "Total Number of Sites with Cultural and/or Historical Significance Newly
  Identified, Registered, and Preserved" indicator measures the total count of
  new sites that have been identified as having cultural or historical
  significance, officially registered with relevant authorities, and preserved
  within a given period. These sites may include monuments, buildings,
  landscapes, archaeological sites, and other locations of importance to a
  community's heritage.

  sites that hold cultural or historical value. The process involves recognizing
  sites for their significance, officially registering them to ensure legal
  protection, and implementing measures to conserve and maintain them. The
  indicator reflects the commitment of governments, cultural institutions, and
  communities to safeguarding their heritage and ensuring that significant sites
  are protected for future generations.

  are newly identified, registered, and preserved is crucial for assessing the
  effectiveness of heritage conservation efforts. The preservation of these
  sites is vital for maintaining cultural identity, educating the public, and
  promoting tourism.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of Sites with Cultural and/or Historical
  Significance Newly Identified, Registered, and Preserved," first identify and
  list all sites that have been newly recognized as culturally or historically
  significant within the specified period. Then, verify that each site has been
  officially registered with the relevant authorities and confirm that
  preservation measures have been implemented. Finally, count the total number
  of sites that meet these criteria.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Newly Identified, Registered, and Preserved Sites = Sum of All
  Verified Sites with Cultural/Historical Significance Newly Registered and
  Preserved
