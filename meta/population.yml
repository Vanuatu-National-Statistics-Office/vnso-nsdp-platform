Definition: >-
  The indicator “Projected Population by Sex, Age Group, and Province” is the
  estimated number of individuals projected to reside in each province of
  Vanuatu, disaggregated by sex and 5-year age groups, for each year from 2020
  to 2050.
Concept: >-
  This indicator is based on the demographic concept of population projections,
  which are forward-looking estimates derived from the most recent census base
  population, adjusted using assumptions about future trends in fertility,
  mortality, and migration. It supports long-term planning, including
  infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social services, by estimating
  future population dynamics by region, age, and sex.
Disaggregation: None
Rationale: >-
  Population projections provide critical insights for national and provincial
  policy and planning. Disaggregating the data by age and sex allows for
  assessment of demographic shifts, ageing trends, youth bulges, and population
  growth or decline in specific areas. These insights inform targeted
  investments, especially in health, education, and economic development.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Method of Computation: 

  Projections are calculated using the cohort-component method, which applies
  age-specific fertility, mortality, and migration rates to a base year
  population. Each subsequent year's population is derived by aging the
  population forward and applying assumptions for births, deaths, and net
  migration.


  Formula: 

  Not applicable — total projected population counts by age group, sex, and
  province are produced through demographic modelling, not a single formula.
