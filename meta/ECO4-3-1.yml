Definition: >-
  The "Total Number of Processed Local Products Produced Per Annum for Domestic
  Consumption and Export" indicator measures the total quantity of locally
  sourced and processed products that are produced annually for both domestic
  consumption and export markets. These products include goods that have
  undergone value-added processing within the country, such as food items,
  beverages, textiles, and other manufactured goods derived from local raw
  materials.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the production volume of processed goods that originate
  from local raw materials and are either consumed domestically or exported.
  Processing local products adds value to raw materials, enhances the economic
  potential of local industries, and can contribute significantly to a country’s
  GDP. The indicator provides insights into the capacity and growth of the local
  processing industry, the extent of value addition, and the potential of local
  products to compete in both domestic and international markets.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of processed local products produced per annum is
  crucial for understanding the development of the local processing industry and
  its contribution to the economy. A high production volume indicates a strong
  processing sector that adds value to raw materials, creates jobs, and
  generates income through domestic sales and exports.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Total Number of Processed Local Products Produced Per Annum
  for Domestic Consumption and Export," first collect data on the total
  production volumes of locally processed products for the year. Categorize the
  data based on whether the products are intended for domestic consumption or
  export. Sum the total number of processed products produced for both domestic
  and export markets to obtain the overall production figure for the year.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Processed Local Products= Total Processed Products for
  Domestic Consumption + Total Processed Products for Export
