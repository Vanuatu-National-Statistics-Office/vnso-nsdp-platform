Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Households Using Renewable Energy Technology as Main Source
  of Lighting" indicator measures the percentage of households within a specific
  region or country that use renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind,
  or biogas, as their primary source of lighting. This indicator reflects the
  adoption and reliance on sustainable energy sources for household lighting
  needs.  
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which households have transitioned from
  conventional, non-renewable energy sources (such as kerosene, coal, or grid
  electricity generated from fossil fuels) to renewable energy technologies for
  lighting. Renewable energy technologies offer a sustainable alternative that
  reduces dependence on fossil fuels, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and
  supports energy security. The indicator provides insights into the progress of
  energy transition efforts and the spread of clean energy technologies at the
  household level.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of households using renewable energy for lighting is
  crucial for assessing the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed at
  promoting clean energy adoption. High levels of renewable energy use for
  lighting contribute to environmental sustainability, reduce household energy
  costs, and improve access to reliable lighting, especially in remote or
  off-grid areas.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Households Using Renewable Energy Technology as
  Main Source of Lighting," first collect data on the total number of households
  within the region or country. Then, gather data on the number of households
  that use renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, or biogas, as
  their primary source of lighting. Next, divide the number of households using
  renewable energy for lighting by the total number of households. Finally,
  multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Households Using Renewable Energy for Lighting (%) = (Number of
  Households Using Renewable Energy for Lighting/Total Number of Households) *
  100
