  The "Percentage of National Strategy for the Development of Statistics
  Strategic Objectives Achieved" indicator measures the proportion of strategic
  objectives outlined in the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics
  (NSDS) that have been successfully accomplished within a specified period.
  This indicator reflects the progress made toward enhancing the national
  statistical system's capacity, quality, and effectiveness.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the implementation and success of the NSDS, a
  comprehensive framework designed to improve the production, dissemination, and
  use of statistics within a country. The NSDS typically includes a range of
  strategic objectives aimed at strengthening statistical capacity, improving
  data quality, enhancing coordination among statistical agencies, and ensuring
  the availability of reliable and timely data for decision-making. The
  achievement of these objectives is critical for building a robust national
  statistical system that can support evidence-based policymaking and
  sustainable development.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of NSDS strategic objectives achieved is crucial for
  assessing the effectiveness of efforts to strengthen the national statistical
  system. High achievement rates indicate that the country is making significant
  progress in implementing its statistical development strategy, which is
  essential for producing high-quality data that informs policy and
  decision-making. Conversely, low achievement rates may signal challenges in
  the implementation process, such as resource constraints, lack of
  coordination, or insufficient capacity.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of National Strategy for the Development of
  Statistics Strategic Objectives Achieved," first identify and list all
  strategic objectives outlined in the NSDS. Then, collect data on the progress
  made toward each objective and determine how many have been fully achieved.
  Divide the number of achieved objectives by the total number of strategic
  objectives, and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of NSDS Objectives Achieved (%) = (Number of Strategic Objectives
  Achieved/Total Number of Strategic Objectives in the NSDS) * 100
