Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Extraction Activities Complying with Environmental Impact
  Assessment (EIA) Requirements" indicator measures the percentage of extraction
  activities—such as mining, quarrying, logging, and other resource extraction
  operations—that have successfully undergone and complied with Environmental
  Impact Assessment (EIA) processes as mandated by law. Compliance includes the
  completion of the EIA process, approval from relevant authorities, and the
  implementation of the recommended environmental management and mitigation
  measures.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adherence of extraction activities to environmental
  regulations through the Environmental Impact Assessment process. An EIA is a
  crucial tool used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of proposed
  extraction activities before they commence. It ensures that environmental
  considerations are integrated into the planning and decision-making process,
  helping to prevent or minimize negative environmental impacts. The indicator
  reflects the level of compliance within the extraction industry and the
  effectiveness of regulatory oversight in protecting the environment.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of extraction activities that comply with EIA
  requirements is essential for promoting sustainable resource management and
  protecting the environment. Compliance with EIA requirements helps to mitigate
  the adverse effects of extraction activities on ecosystems, biodiversity,
  water resources, and local communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Extraction Activities Complying with
  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Requirements," first identify all
  extraction activities that are legally required to undergo an EIA. Assess
  whether each activity has completed the EIA process and is in compliance with
  the recommendations and conditions outlined in the EIA report. Calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of compliant activities by the total number
  of extraction activities requiring an EIA, and multiply by 100 to express the
  result as a percentage.




  Formula:

  Proportion of Compliant Activities (%) = (Number of Extraction Activities
  Complying with EIA Requirements/Total Number of Extraction Activities
  Requiring EIA) * 100
