Definition: >-
  The indicator “Exports by Commodity and Country” measures the total value,
  quantity, and unit price of goods exported from the country, disaggregated by
  commodity type and destination country. It reflects the composition and
  destination of national export flows.
Concept: >-
  The indicator is based on the concept of export-led growth and trade
  performance monitoring. Exports are a critical driver of economic development,
  foreign exchange earnings, and sectoral competitiveness. Disaggregating
  exports by commodity allows for sector-specific insights (e.g. agriculture,
  manufacturing), while analysis by country reveals trading relationships,
  market access, and export concentration risk. The inclusion of unit prices
  enables assessment of product competitiveness and value-addition trends.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring exports is essential to understand how the national economy engages
  in international markets. Increases in export value may reflect improved
  global demand, increased production, or enhanced trade terms. Tracking exports
  by product supports sectoral planning (e.g. boosting cocoa or kava exports),
  while tracking by country highlights dependency on specific markets or
  emerging trade opportunities. Unit prices provide further context, helping
  identify price competitiveness and market positioning of key commodities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Export Value: Sum the reported value of each exported commodity by year and
  destination country, based on customs declarations.

  Export Quantity: Sum the total physical quantity (in kg/tonnes/litres) of each
  commodity exported.

  Unit Price: Divide export value by quantity to calculate the price per unit.


  Formula: 

  Total Export Value (VUV) = ∑ Export value by commodity and country

  Total Export Quantity (kg/tonnes/litres) = ∑ Export quantity by commodity

  Unit Price = Export Value ÷ Export Quantity
