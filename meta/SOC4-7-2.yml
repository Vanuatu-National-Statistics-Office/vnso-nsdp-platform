  Monitoring the number of government-sponsored or partnered sporting events
  provides insights into the government's commitment to promoting sports and
  physical activity. A higher number of events indicates active government
  involvement in providing opportunities for citizens to engage in sports, which
  is essential for public health, social cohesion, and national pride.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Government Sponsored or Partnered Sporting Events in
  the Last 12 Months," first identify and list all sporting events that occurred
  within the specified period and were sponsored or partnered by the government.
  Then, verify the government's involvement in each event through records,
  agreements, or official announcements. Finally, count the total number of
  these events to determine the indicator value.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Government-Sponsored or Partnered Sporting Events = Sum of All
  Sporting Events Organized or Partnered by Government in 12 months
