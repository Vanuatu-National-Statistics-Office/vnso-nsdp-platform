  The "Percentage of Public Schools Using the Climate Change and Disaster Risk
  Reduction Modules in National Curriculum at All Levels" indicator measures the
  proportion of public schools that have integrated and are actively using
  climate change and disaster risk reduction (DRR) educational modules within
  the national curriculum across all grade levels. This indicator reflects the
  extent to which these critical topics are being taught in the education
  system.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption and implementation of educational content
  focused on climate change and disaster risk reduction within public schools.
  These modules are designed to educate students on the science of climate
  change, the importance of sustainability, and strategies to reduce disaster
  risks. By incorporating these topics into the national curriculum, the
  education system plays a crucial role in building a more informed and
  resilient future
  generation.                                                                                 
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >
  Monitoring the percentage of public schools using climate change and DRR
  modules in the curriculum is essential for assessing the effectiveness of
  efforts to mainstream these topics into education. Teaching students about
  climate change and disaster risk reduction is key to raising awareness,
  fostering proactive attitudes, and equipping young people with the knowledge
  and skills needed to respond to and mitigate the impacts of environmental
  challenges.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Public Schools Using the Climate Change and
  Disaster Risk Reduction Modules in National Curriculum at All Levels," first
  identify all public schools that are part of the national education system.
  Assess whether these schools have integrated the climate change and disaster
  risk reduction modules into their curriculum across all levels of education.
  Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of schools using the modules
  by the total number of public schools, and multiply by 100 to express the
  result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Schools Using CC & DRR Modules (%) = (Number of Public Schools
  Using the Modules / Total Number of Public Schools) × 100
