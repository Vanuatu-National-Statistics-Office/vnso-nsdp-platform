Definition: >-
  The indicator “Number of Children Attending School by Province, Island, and
  Class” measures the total number of children who are physically attending
  school during a given academic year, disaggregated by province, island, and
  class level.
Concept: >-
  School attendance refers to the presence of children in formal learning
  environments on a regular basis, as distinct from enrolment figures which may
  include those registered but not attending. "Class" indicates the grade or
  level of schooling (e.g. Class 1, Class 2), while "island" and "province"
  identify the geographic location of the school. Together, these dimensions
  enable detailed spatial and educational analysis of participation in the
  school system.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring actual school attendance is critical for understanding access to
  education and identifying barriers to sustained participation. Disaggregation
  by class, island, and province allows for targeted policy responses to address
  regional disparities, dropout risks, and education resource gaps. It also
  supports planning efforts for teacher deployment, infrastructure investment,
  and inclusive education strategies.
MethodOfComputation: >
  This indicator is calculated using administrative records collected from
  schools or education offices. Data is aggregated to count the number of
  attending students per class level, island, and province within a given school
  year.


  Formula: 

  None required, the indicator is a direct count of children attending school.
