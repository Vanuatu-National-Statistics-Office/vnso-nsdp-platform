Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Government Departments with Gender-Responsive Policies,
  Legislation, and Programs" indicator measures the percentage of government
  departments that have developed, implemented, and actively maintain policies,
  legislation, and programs specifically designed to address gender equality and
  the needs of different genders. Gender-responsive approaches are those that
  recognize and address the different needs, opportunities, and challenges faced
  by all genders, with a focus on promoting equality and inclusion.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which government departments are
  integrating gender considerations into their policies, laws, and programs.
  Gender-responsive policies and programs aim to reduce gender disparities,
  promote equal opportunities, and ensure that the impacts of government actions
  are equitable across all genders. The indicator reflects the commitment of
  government institutions to mainstream gender equality across all areas of
  public administration.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of government departments with gender-responsive
  policies, legislation, and programs is essential for assessing the
  government's commitment to gender equality. It provides insight into how well
  gender considerations are being integrated into the broader policy and
  legislative framework. High proportions indicate that gender equality is being
  systematically addressed across government departments, which is crucial for
  creating an inclusive society.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Government Departments with Gender-Responsive
  Policies, Legislation, and Programs," first identify and list all relevant
  government departments. Then, assess each department to determine whether they
  have developed and implemented gender-responsive policies, legislation, and
  programs. Next, count the number of departments that meet this criterion and
  divide it by the total number of departments identified. Finally, multiply the
  result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Government Departments with Gender Responsive Policies (%) =
  (Number of Departments with Gender Responsive Measures/Total Number of
  Departments Assessed) * 100
