  the percentage of educational institutions (both formal and informal) and
  health facilities across the country that are affiliated with or receive

  in the provision of education and healthcare services. Religious affiliation
  and support can involve financial contributions, governance participation,

Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of educational institutions and health facilities
  with religious affiliation and support is important for understanding the
  influence and reach of religious organizations in these sectors. Religious
  organizations often play a significant role in providing education and
  healthcare, especially in areas where government resources are limited.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of National Formal and Informal Educational
  Institutions and Health Facilities with Religious Affiliation and Support,"
  first identify and list all relevant educational institutions and health
  facilities within the country. Then, gather data on the number of these
  institutions and facilities that are affiliated with or receive support from
  religious organizations. Next, divide the number of institutions with
  religious affiliation and support by the total number of such institutions and
  facilities identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Institutions/Facilities with Religious Affiliation (%) = (Number
  of Religiously Affiliated/Supported Institutions and Facilities/Total Number
  of Educational and Health Institutions and Facilities) * 100
