  Then, collect data on how many of these positions are held by individuals with
  disabilities. Next, divide the number of leadership positions held by people
  with disabilities by the total number of leadership positions identified.
  Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of leadership
  positions with disability representation as a percentage.
