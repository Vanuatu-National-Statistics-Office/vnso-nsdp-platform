  The "Proportion of Population with Ability to 1: Produce Herbal Medicines, and
  2: Massage" indicator measures the percentage of the population that possesses
  the knowledge and skills to produce traditional herbal medicines and perform
  traditional massage techniques. These skills are often passed down through
  generations and play a crucial role in maintaining traditional health
  practices and cultural heritage.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the retention and transmission of traditional
  health-related skills within a population. The ability to produce herbal
  medicines involves knowledge of local plants, their medicinal properties, and
  the methods of preparing them for therapeutic use. The ability to perform
  massage encompasses techniques that have been traditionally used for healing,
  relaxation, and maintaining physical well-being. Together, these skills are an
  integral part of traditional healthcare systems and reflect the cultural
  practices related to health and wellness.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population that can produce herbal medicines
  and perform massage is essential for assessing the vitality of traditional
  health practices. As modern medicine becomes more widespread, these
  traditional skills may be at risk of being lost.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Ability to 1: Produce Herbal
  Medicines, and 2: Massage," first collect data through surveys or census to
  assess individuals' proficiency in these traditional health skills. Identify
  the number of respondents who possess the knowledge and skills to produce
  herbal medicines and/or perform traditional massage. Calculate the proportion
  by dividing the number of skilled individuals by the total population
  surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Traditional Health Skills (%) = (Number of
  Individuals with Herbal Medicine and Massage Skills/Total Population Surveyed)
  * 100
