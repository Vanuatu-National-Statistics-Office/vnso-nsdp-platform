Definition: >-
  The "Under-5 Mortality Rate" indicator measures the probability that a child
  born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five, expressed
  per 1,000 live births. This rate captures the risk of death during the first
  five years of life, a critical period in a child's development.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the overall health and well-being of children under five
  years old, reflecting the effectiveness of a country’s health system,
  particularly in areas such as maternal health, neonatal care, immunization,
  nutrition, and disease prevention. The under-5 mortality rate is a key metric
  used globally to assess child health and survival.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the under-5 mortality rate is essential for understanding the
  health status of a population, particularly the most vulnerable age
  group—infants and young children. A high under-5 mortality rate indicates
  challenges in healthcare delivery, such as inadequate maternal and child
  health services, poor nutrition, and lack of access to clean water and
  sanitation. Conversely, a declining under-5 mortality rate suggests
  improvements in these areas.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Under-5 Mortality Rate," first collect data on the total
  number of deaths of children under five years old within a specified period.
  Then, obtain data on the total number of live births during the same period.
  Next, divide the number of deaths of children under five by the total number
  of live births, and multiply the result by 1,000 to express the rate as the
  number of deaths per 1,000 live births.
