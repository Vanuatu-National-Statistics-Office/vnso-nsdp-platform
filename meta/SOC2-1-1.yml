  The "Percentage of Age 6 in Year 1 Who Attended Kindergarten" indicator
  measures the percentage of children who, at age 6 and in their first year of
  formal schooling (Year 1), previously attended kindergarten. This reflects
  early childhood education participation before entering primary school.


  The "Survival Rates Years 1-6, Years 1-13" indicator measures the percentage
  of students who start in Year 1 and successfully progress through to Year 6
  and Year 13, respectively, without dropping out. It reflects the ability of
  the education system to retain students through primary (Years 1-6) and
  secondary (Years 7-13) education.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the participation in early childhood education
  (kindergarten) among children who have reached the age of 6 and are enrolled
  in Year 1 of formal schooling. Attendance in kindergarten is an important
  foundation for cognitive, social, and emotional development, preparing
  children for the structured learning environment of primary school.


  This indicator tracks the retention and progression of students through the
  formal education system, focusing on key educational milestones: completing
  primary education (Year 6) and secondary education (Year 13). High survival
  rates indicate effective education policies, student engagement, and the
  overall health of the education system.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of children in Year 1 who attended kindergarten is
  essential for evaluating the effectiveness and reach of early childhood
  education programs. Early education is crucial for children's development,
  influencing their future academic performance and social skills. 


  Monitoring survival rates from Year 1 through Year 6 and Year 13 is critical
  for evaluating the performance and inclusivity of the education system. It
  highlights the ability of schools to retain students, ensure they complete
  essential educational stages, and identify potential drop-out points.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute this percentage, first gather data on the total number of children
  aged 6 enrolled in Year 1 and identify how many of these children attended
  kindergarten. Then, divide the number of Year 1 students who attended
  kindergarten by the total number of Year 1 students aged 6. Finally, multiply
  the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.


  To compute the survival rates, begin by collecting data on the number of
  students who enrolled in Year 1, and then determine how many of those students
  completed Year 6 and Year 13. For the survival rate from Year 1 to Year 6,
  divide the number of students who completed Year 6 by the number who initially
  enrolled in Year 1, and multiply the result by 100 to express it as a
  percentage. Similarly, for the survival rate from Year 1 to Year 13, divide
  the number of students who completed Year 13 by the number who initially
  enrolled in Year 1, and multiply the result by 100 to express it as a
  percentage.



  Formula:

  Percentage of Age 6 in Year 1 Who Attended Kindergarten (%) = (Number of
  Children Who Attended Kindergarten/Total Number of Children Aged 6 in Year 1)
  * 100


  Formula:

  Survival Rate (Years 1-6) = (Number of Students Reaching Year 6/Number of
  Students Enrolled in Year 1) * 100

  Survival Rate (Years 1-13) = (Number of Students Reaching Year 13/Number of
  Students Enrolled in Year 1) * 100
