  The "Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index Compared to the National
  Consumer Price Index (CPI)" indicator measures the rate at which food prices
  are increasing or decreasing relative to the overall price level of goods and
  services in the country. This indicator compares changes in the Food Price
  Index (FPI) with the broader Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of
  the average change in prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer
  goods and services, including food.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the relative inflation of food prices compared to the
  general inflation rate in the economy. The Food Price Index focuses
  specifically on the prices of food items, while the Consumer Price Index
  encompasses a wider range of goods and services. By comparing the FPI with the
  CPI, this indicator provides insights into whether food prices are rising or
  falling at a faster or slower rate than the overall cost of living.
Disaggregation: Food type
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index in relation to
  the National CPI is essential for understanding the dynamics of food prices
  within the broader economic context. Food price inflation can significantly
  affect household budgets, especially for low-income families, and can lead to
  food insecurity if prices rise more rapidly than overall inflation.
  Conversely, if food prices increase at a slower rate than other goods and
  services, it may indicate improved affordability of food.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index Compared to the
  National Consumer Price Index (CPI)," first collect data on the prices of a
  basket of commonly consumed food items to calculate the Food Price Index
  (FPI). Then, obtain the National CPI, which tracks the overall price level of
  goods and services. Calculate the Food Price Inflation Rate by comparing the
  FPI over two periods and expressing the percentage change. Finally, compare
  this food price inflation rate to the CPI inflation rate by dividing the two,
  which provides insights into how food prices are rising or falling relative to
  overall inflation in the economy.


  Formula:

  *Food Price Inflation Rate (%) = (FPI in Current Period – FPI in Previous
  Period)/(FPI in Previous Period)) * 100


  *Comparison Ratio = Food Price Inflation Rate / CPI Inflation Rate
