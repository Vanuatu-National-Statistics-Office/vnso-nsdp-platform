Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Annual Spending on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster
  Risk Management Funded with Budget Support from Donor Partners to the
  Government" indicator measures the percentage of total government expenditure
  on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (DRM) that is
  financed through budget support provided by international donor partners. This
  indicator reflects the extent to which government efforts in these areas are
  supported by external funding sources.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the reliance on external financial support from donor
  partners for government initiatives related to climate change adaptation and
  disaster risk management. Budget support refers to direct financial
  contributions provided by donor partners to the government, which are used to
  fund specific programs and activities aimed at enhancing climate resilience
  and reducing disaster risks. The indicator provides insights into the degree
  of international collaboration and financial support for the country’s climate
  and disaster management strategies.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of spending on climate change adaptation and DRM
  that is funded by donor partners is crucial for understanding the financial
  sustainability and international support for these initiatives. External
  funding plays a significant role in enabling governments, particularly in
  developing countries, to implement large-scale adaptation and risk management
  programs that might otherwise be unaffordable.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Annual Spending on Climate Change Adaptation and
  Disaster Risk Management Funded with Budget Support from Donor Partners to the
  Government," first collect data on the total annual government expenditure on
  climate change adaptation and DRM. Then, gather data on the amount of budget
  support provided by donor partners for these purposes. Next, divide the amount
  of donor-funded budget support by the total government expenditure on climate
  change adaptation and DRM. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the
  proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Spending Funded by Donors (%) = (Amount of Donor-Funded Budget
  Support/Total Annual Spending on Climate Change and DRM) * 100
