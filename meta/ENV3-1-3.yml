  The "Alignment of Sector Stakeholders’ Programs with Climate Change (CC) &
  Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Policies and Legislation" indicator measures
  the extent to which the programs and activities of various sector stakeholders
  (including government agencies, NGOs, private sector entities, and community
  organizations) are aligned with national policies and legislation on climate
  change and disaster risk management. This alignment reflects how well sectoral
  actions support and are integrated into broader climate and disaster
  resilience objectives.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the degree of coherence and coordination between the
  programs of sector stakeholders and the overarching policies and legislation
  on climate change and disaster risk management. Alignment ensures that
  sector-specific initiatives contribute to national goals, avoid conflicts or
  redundancies, and effectively address the challenges posed by climate change
  and disasters. The indicator helps to assess whether sector stakeholders are
  working in a coordinated manner to achieve common objectives in climate
  resilience and disaster preparedness.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the alignment of sector stakeholders’ programs with CC & DRM
  policies and legislation is critical for ensuring a unified and effective
  approach to managing climate and disaster risks. When programs are aligned
  with national policies, it enhances the effectiveness of interventions,
  maximizes resource use, and ensures that all sectors contribute to building
  resilience.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To assess the "Alignment of Sector Stakeholders’ Programs with Climate Change
  (CC) & Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Policies and Legislation," first
  identify the relevant programs of key sector stakeholders. Then, review the
  national CC & DRM policies and legislation to determine the key objectives and
  requirements. Next, assess the degree of alignment between each stakeholder’s
  programs and these national policies. Optionally, create a scoring system to
  quantify the level of alignment, or calculate the proportion of programs that
  are fully aligned by dividing the number of aligned programs by the total
  number of programs reviewed and expressing the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Aligned Programs (%) = (Number of Fully or Partially Aligned
  Programs/Total Number of Assessed Programs) * 100
