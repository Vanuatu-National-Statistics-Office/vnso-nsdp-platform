Definition: >-
  The "Capacity Utilisation Rate: Manufacturing" indicator measures the extent
  to which a manufacturing company or the manufacturing sector as a whole is
  using its installed productive capacity. This rate is typically expressed as a
  percentage and indicates the ratio of actual output produced to the maximum
  potential output that could be produced with fully utilized resources under
  normal operating conditions.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use within
  the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilisation reflects how well a
  manufacturing plant or sector is using its capital and labour resources.
  High-capacity utilisation rates suggest that the manufacturing sector is
  operating close to its full potential, while low rates may indicate
  underutilization of resources, which could be due to factors such as decreased
  demand, inefficiencies, or operational constraints.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing is crucial for
  understanding the health and performance of the manufacturing sector. A
  high-capacity utilization rate is typically associated with greater economic
  efficiency, higher profitability, and stronger industrial growth. Conversely,
  a low rate may signal challenges such as excess capacity, weak demand, or
  inefficiencies in production processes.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Capacity Utilization Rate: Manufacturing," first collect data
  on the actual output produced by the manufacturing sector during a specified
  period. Then, determine the maximum potential output that could be achieved if
  the sector were operating at full capacity. Calculate the capacity utilization
  rate by dividing the actual output by the maximum potential output and
  multiplying by 100 to express the result as a percentage. This percentage
  indicates the extent to which the manufacturing sector's productive capacity
  is being utilized.


  Formula:

  Capacity Utilization Rate (%) = (Actual Output/Maximum Potential Output)*100
