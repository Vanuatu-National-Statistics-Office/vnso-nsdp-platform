Proxy: Yes (Commercial Financial Services Only)
Definition: >-
  The "Total Number of New Users of Commercial Financial Services Annually,
  Acknowledging Population Growth" indicator measures the annual increase in the
  number of individuals who open new accounts with commercial financial
  institutions, such as banks, credit unions, or microfinance institutions. This
  indicator adjusts for population growth to provide a more accurate assessment
  of the expansion of financial services access.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the expansion of financial inclusion by monitoring the
  number of new accounts opened with commercial financial institutions each
  year. The focus is on commercial financial services, which include savings
  accounts, checking accounts, loans, and other related services provided by
  banks and similar entities. By adjusting for population growth, the indicator
  aims to isolate the true increase in financial service uptake, offering
  insights into the effectiveness of efforts to bring more people into the
  formal financial system.
Disaggregation: Financial Institution
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of new users of commercial financial services
  annually is essential for assessing the progress of financial inclusion
  efforts. Financial inclusion is critical for economic development, as it
  enables individuals to save, invest, access credit, and manage financial
  risks. However, without accounting for population growth, the raw increase in
  new accounts might overestimate the progress in expanding financial access. By
  acknowledging population growth, this indicator provides a clearer picture of
  how effectively financial services are reaching new users beyond the effects
  of demographic changes.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Total Number of New Users of Commercial Financial Services
  Annually, Acknowledging Population Growth," first collect data on the total
  number of new accounts opened with commercial financial institutions during
  the reporting year and the population fifteen and above for the same period.
  To compute the percentage of new users of commercial financial services
  annually, divide the total number of new accounts opened during the year by
  the total population for the same period, and then multiply the result by 100
  to express it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of New Users= (Total Number of New Users/Total Population 15+)*100
