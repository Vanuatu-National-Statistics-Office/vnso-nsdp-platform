Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Visitors Traveling to Outer Islands" indicator measures the
  percentage of total visitors who travel from the main island or primary
  tourist destinations to outer islands within a country or region. This
  indicator reflects the distribution of tourism activity across different
  geographic areas, particularly the less accessible or more remote parts of the
  country.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which visitors explore beyond the main
  island or primary tourist hubs and visit outer islands. Outer islands often
  offer unique cultural, natural, and recreational experiences that differ from
  those available on the main island. By measuring the proportion of visitors
  who venture to these areas, the indicator provides insight into the appeal of
  outer islands as tourist destinations and the effectiveness of efforts to
  promote tourism in these regions. It also highlights the potential for
  spreading the economic benefits of tourism more evenly across the country.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of visitors traveling to outer islands is crucial
  for understanding the spatial distribution of tourism and its economic impact
  on different regions. A higher proportion of visitors traveling to outer
  islands indicates that tourism benefits are being distributed more widely,
  supporting local economies, preserving cultural heritage, and reducing
  pressure on the main island’s infrastructure. Conversely, a lower proportion
  may suggest that more efforts are needed to promote these areas or improve
  access.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Visitors Traveling to Outer Islands," first
  collect data on the number of visitors who travel to outer islands during the
  reporting period and the total number of visitors to the country or region.
  Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of visitors to outer islands
  by the total number of visitors, and multiply by 100 to express it as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Visitors Traveling to Outer Islands (%)= (Number of Visitors to
  Outer Islands/Total Number of Visitors)*100
