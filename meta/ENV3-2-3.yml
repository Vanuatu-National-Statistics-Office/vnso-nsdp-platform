Proxy: 'No'
Definition: >-
  The "Increased Knowledge and Scientific Research in Atmospheric and Earth
  Sciences" indicator measures the growth in knowledge and the volume of
  scientific research conducted in the fields of atmospheric and earth sciences.
  This includes research outputs such as published papers, studies, reports, and
  data collection initiatives that contribute to a better understanding of
  atmospheric processes, climate change, geology, and related environmental
  phenomena.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the expansion of scientific knowledge and research
  activities in atmospheric and earth sciences. These fields encompass the study
  of weather, climate, air quality, geological processes, and the Earth's
  physical structure. The indicator reflects the efforts made by academic
  institutions, research organizations, and government agencies to advance
  scientific understanding of these critical areas, which are essential for
  informed decision-making, environmental management, and addressing global
  challenges such as climate change.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the increase in knowledge and scientific research in atmospheric
  and earth sciences is crucial for supporting evidence-based policymaking and
  improving the management of natural resources and environmental risks.
  Enhanced scientific research contributes to the development of more accurate
  climate models, better predictions of natural disasters, and more effective
  strategies for mitigating and adapting to environmental changes.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Increased Knowledge and Scientific Research in Atmospheric and
  Earth Sciences" indicator, first collect data on the number of research
  publications, projects, and studies related to atmospheric and earth sciences.
  Evaluate the quality and impact of these research outputs. Then, compare the
  current volume of research with baseline data from previous periods to
  calculate the increase in research outputs. Express this increase as a
  percentage or count of additional outputs.



  Formula:

  Increase in Research Outputs (%) = ((Current Number of Research Outputs −
  Baseline Number of Research Outputs/Baseline Number of Research Outputs)) *
