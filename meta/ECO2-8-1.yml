Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Procurement Contracts Issued for Island-Based Contractors
  and Community-Based Contractors" indicator measures the percentage of
  procurement contracts awarded to contractors who are based on islands or
  within specific communities, as opposed to external or mainland-based
  entities. This indicator reflects the extent to which local contractors are
  involved in government or large-scale private sector procurement processes.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the share of procurement opportunities that are being
  accessed by local contractors, specifically those based on islands or within
  local communities. It emphasizes the importance of involving local businesses
  in procurement processes to stimulate local economies, build local capacity,
  and ensure that the benefits of procurement spending are retained within the
  community or region. The indicator is important in assessing the inclusivity
  and effectiveness of procurement policies in supporting local development.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of procurement contracts issued to island-based and
  community-based contractors is crucial for promoting local economic
  development and ensuring that procurement practices contribute to the
  sustainability and resilience of local communities. By favouring local
  contractors, governments and organizations can help create jobs, retain wealth
  within the community, and build local capacity.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Procurement Contracts Issued for Island-Based
  Contractors and Community-Based Contractors," first collect data on the total
  number of procurement contracts awarded and identify those awarded to
  island-based and community-based contractors. Then, calculate the proportion
  by dividing the number of contracts awarded to these local contractors by the
  total number of procurement contracts awarded, and multiply by 100 to express
  it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Contracts for Island or Community-Based Contractors= (Contracts
  Awarded to Island or Community Based Contractors/Total Number of Procurement
  Contracts Awarded)*100
