Definition: >-
  The "Number of Diabetic (NCD) Related Amputations" indicator measures the
  total number of amputations performed due to complications arising from
  diabetes, a non-communicable disease (NCD). These amputations are typically
  the result of severe, uncontrolled diabetes leading to conditions such as
  peripheral artery disease, neuropathy, and infections that do not heal
  properly.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of severe diabetes-related complications
  within a population. Diabetes is a chronic condition that, when poorly
  managed, can lead to serious health issues, including the need for limb
  amputation. Monitoring the number of diabetic-related amputations provides
  insight into the burden of diabetes on the healthcare system and the
  effectiveness of diabetes management and preventive care programs.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of diabetic-related amputations is crucial for assessing
  the impact of diabetes on public health and the effectiveness of interventions
  aimed at controlling diabetes and preventing complications. High rates of
  amputations suggest inadequate diabetes management, lack of access to
  healthcare, or delayed treatment of complications.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Diabetic (NCD) Related Amputations," first collect
  data on the total number of amputations performed within the specified period
  that are attributed to diabetes complications. Verify that each amputation
  counted is directly related to diabetes by reviewing medical records or
  diagnoses. Finally, sum the total number of diabetic-related amputations
  within the period.



  Formula:

  Number of Diabetic-Related Amputations = Sum of All Amputations Due to
  Diabetic Complications
