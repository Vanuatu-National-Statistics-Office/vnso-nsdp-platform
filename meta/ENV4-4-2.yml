  The "Number of Integrated Coastal Management Plans Developed and Implemented"
  indicator measures the total count of comprehensive management plans that have
  been formulated and put into action to manage and protect coastal areas. These
  plans are designed to address the complex and interconnected issues affecting
  coastal zones, including environmental conservation, sustainable resource use,
  disaster risk reduction, and socio-economic development.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the efforts made to establish and execute Integrated
  Coastal Management (ICM) plans, which are strategic frameworks that guide the
  sustainable development and management of coastal areas. ICM plans are
  holistic and multidisciplinary, incorporating environmental, social, and
  economic considerations to ensure the long-term health and resilience of
  coastal ecosystems and communities. The indicator reflects the progress in
  adopting a coordinated approach to managing coastal resources and mitigating
  the impacts of human activities and natural hazards.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of integrated coastal management plans developed and
  implemented is essential for assessing the effectiveness of coastal governance
  and the commitment to sustainable coastal development. Coastal areas are often
  under significant pressure from activities such as tourism, fishing,
  urbanization, and industrialization, as well as from the impacts of climate
  change and natural disasters. ICM plans help to balance these competing
  interests, protect coastal ecosystems, and enhance the resilience of coastal
  communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Integrated Coastal Management Plans Developed and
  Implemented," first identify all Integrated Coastal Management plans that have
  been developed for coastal areas. Verify that these plans are not only created
  but are also actively being implemented by reviewing reports and monitoring
  outcomes. Then, count the total number of ICM plans that have been both
  developed and put into action within the reporting period.


  Formula:

  Total Number of ICM Plans Developed and Implemented = Sum of All Verified ICM
  Plans Developed and Implemented
