Definition: >-
  The "Percentage of Aid for the Government Sector Using Vanuatu Government
  Procurement Systems" indicator measures the proportion of total aid provided
  to the Vanuatu government sector that is managed through the government's own
  procurement systems. This includes the processes of tendering, contracting,
  and purchasing goods and services as defined by Vanuatu’s public procurement
  regulations and procedures.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent to which external aid provided to the Vanuatu
  government is procured through the country’s own procurement systems.
  Utilizing the national procurement systems for aid-funded projects and
  programs is essential for ensuring that external funds are spent in accordance
  with local laws and procedures. This practice also supports the development
  and strengthening of national procurement capacity, promotes transparency, and
  aligns external resources with national priorities.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of aid using Vanuatu’s procurement systems is
  crucial for assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of aid management.
  When aid is managed through the country’s own procurement systems, it
  reinforces local ownership, strengthens institutional capacity, and enhances
  transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. A higher
  percentage indicates better integration of aid into national processes,
  supporting long-term development goals and reducing the reliance on parallel
  systems that can undermine local governance. Conversely, a lower percentage
  may highlight challenges in harmonizing aid with national procurement systems
  and suggest areas where improvements are needed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Aid for the Government Sector Using Vanuatu
  Government Procurement Systems," first collect data on the total amount of aid
  provided to the government sector during the reporting period. Then, collect
  data on the amount of this aid that is managed through the Vanuatu
  government’s procurement systems. Divide the amount of aid using these systems
  by the total amount of aid provided, and multiply the result by 100 to express
  the proportion as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Aid Using Procurement Systems (%) = (Aid managed through
  Vanuatu’s Procurement Systems/Total Aid Provided to the Government Sector) *
  100
