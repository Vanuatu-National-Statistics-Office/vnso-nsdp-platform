Definition: >-
  The "Prevalence of Obesity in Adult Population" indicator measures the
  percentage of adults (typically aged 18 and above) in a given population who
  are classified as obese. Obesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI)
  of 30 or higher, where BMI is calculated as a person's weight in kilograms
  divided by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²).
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the prevalence of obesity within the adult population,
  which is a significant public health concern. Obesity is associated with an
  increased risk of numerous health conditions, including heart disease,
  diabetes, stroke, and certain types of cancer. The prevalence of obesity is an
  important measure of the overall health and nutritional status of a
  population, as well as a key indicator of the effectiveness of public health
  interventions aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic
  diseases.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the prevalence of obesity in the adult population is essential for
  assessing the burden of obesity-related health conditions and the
  effectiveness of public health policies and programs. High prevalence rates
  may indicate a need for enhanced efforts to promote healthy eating, physical
  activity, and weight management within the population
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Prevalence of Obesity in Adult Population," first collect data
  on the height and weight of adults to calculate their BMI. Classify
  individuals as obese if their BMI is 30 or higher. Calculate the prevalence by
  dividing the number of obese adults by the total number of adults surveyed,
  and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Prevalence of Obesity (%) = ((Number of Obese adults (BMI ≥ 30))/Total Number
  of Adults Surveyed) * 100
