Definition: >-
  The "Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)/Number of Maternal Deaths" indicator
  measures the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births within a
  specific period, typically a year. A maternal death is defined as the death of
  a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy, from
  any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not
  from accidental or incidental causes.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the risk of death associated with pregnancy and
  childbirth. The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is a critical indicator of the
  quality of a country’s healthcare system, particularly its ability to provide
  effective maternal and reproductive health services. The number of maternal
  deaths is a raw count of the actual deaths that occur due to pregnancy-related
  causes within the specified period.
Disaggregation: 'Region, Age'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the Maternal Mortality Ratio and the number of maternal deaths is
  crucial for assessing the effectiveness of maternal health programs and the
  accessibility and quality of healthcare services for women. High MMRs indicate
  a need for improved healthcare services, better access to skilled birth
  attendants, and enhanced maternal care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the
  postpartum period.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Maternal Mortality Ratio/Number of Maternal Deaths," first
  collect data on the total number of maternal deaths within the specified
  period. Then, obtain the total number of live births during the same period.
  Next, calculate the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) by dividing the number of
  maternal deaths by the total number of live births and multiply the result by
  100,000 to express it per 100,000 live births. The number of maternal deaths
  can also be reported directly as a raw count.


  Formula:

  Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) = (Number of Maternal Deaths/Number of Live
  Births) * 100,000
