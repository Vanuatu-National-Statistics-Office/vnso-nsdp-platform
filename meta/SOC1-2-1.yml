  The "Proportion of Population with Knowledge of Traditional Stories, Dances,
  Songs, and Games" indicator measures the percentage of the population that
  possesses knowledge of traditional cultural expressions, including stories,
  dances, songs, and games, which are passed down through generations within a
  community or culture.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the preservation and transmission of intangible cultural
  heritage, focusing on the extent to which traditional knowledge is retained
  and practiced within a population. Traditional stories, dances, songs, and
  games are integral to a community’s identity, social cohesion, and cultural
  continuity. They embody collective values, beliefs, and historical
  experiences, and their transmission from one generation to the next is
  essential for maintaining cultural heritage.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with knowledge of traditional
  cultural practices is crucial for assessing the vitality of cultural heritage
  and the effectiveness of efforts to preserve and promote these traditions. As
  modern influences and globalization can lead to the erosion of traditional
  knowledge, this indicator helps identify areas where cultural practices may be
  declining and where revitalization efforts are needed.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Population with Knowledge of Traditional
  Stories, Dances, Songs, and Games," first collect data through surveys or
  census to assess individuals' familiarity with these cultural expressions.
  Identify the number of respondents who demonstrate knowledge of traditional
  stories, dances, songs, and games. Calculate the proportion by dividing the
  number of knowledgeable individuals by the total population surveyed, and
  multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Population with Cultural Knowledge (%) = (Number of Individuals
  with Knowledge of Traditional Stories, Dances, Songs and Games/Total
  Population Surveyed) * 100
