Definition: >-
  The "Change in Government Revenue (GFS Tables)" indicator measures the
  year-over-year or period-over-period change in the total revenue collected by
  the government, as reported in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) tables.
  Government revenue includes all income generated by the government from taxes,
  fees, fines, grants, and other sources of public funds.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the fluctuation in government revenue over time,
  providing insights into the government's fiscal capacity and its ability to
  fund public services, infrastructure, and development programs. The GFS tables
  are standardized financial reports used by governments worldwide to present
  detailed information on government revenue, expenditure, and financing in a
  consistent and comparable format

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the change in government revenue is crucial for understanding the
  fiscal health and sustainability of a government. An increase in revenue may
  indicate economic growth, improved tax collection, or successful policy
  measures, while a decrease may signal economic challenges, reduced tax base,
  or inefficiencies in revenue collection.
MethodOfComputation: >+
  To compute the "Change in Government Revenue (GFS Tables)," first collect data
  on total government revenue for the current year and the previous year from
  the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) tables. Then, calculate the change in
  revenue by subtracting the previous year's total revenue from the current
  year's total revenue. If expressing the change as a percentage, divide the
  difference by the previous year's total revenue and multiply by 100.


  Formula:

  Percentage Change in Government Revenue= (Total Revenue (Current Year) – Total
  Revenue (Previous Year)/ Total Revenue (Previous Year))*100
