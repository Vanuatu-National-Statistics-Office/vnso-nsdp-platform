Definition: >-
  The "Domestic Food Price Level" indicator measures the average price of a
  basket of commonly consumed food items within a country over a specified
  period. This indicator reflects the cost of food in the domestic market and is
  typically monitored on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis to track changes
  in food prices.
Concept: >-
  This indicator provides an overview of the cost of food in a domestic economy,
  which is a key factor in assessing food affordability and accessibility for
  households. The basket of food items used for this indicator usually includes
  staple foods such as grains, vegetables, fruits, meat, dairy products, and
  other essential food products. The indicator helps to capture the fluctuations
  in food prices due to various factors, including supply and demand dynamics,
  inflation, production levels, import prices, and other economic conditions.
Disaggregation: Food type
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the domestic food price level is crucial for understanding the
  economic burden of food on households, particularly low-income families. High
  food prices can lead to food insecurity, especially among low-income
  households, and can contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy.
  Conversely, stable or decreasing food prices can improve access to nutrition
  and support economic stability.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Method of computation:

  To compute the "Domestic Food Price Level," first collect data on the prices
  of a basket of commonly consumed food items. Then, calculate the average price
  level by taking the weighted or unweighted average of the prices of these
  items. The weights, if used, should reflect the importance of each item in the
  average household's diet. This average represents the domestic food price
  level, which can be compared over time to monitor changes in food prices and
  assess their impact on food security and the cost of living.


  Formula:

  **Domestic Food Price Level = (Total Price of Food Itemi * Weighti/ Total
  Weighti)**
