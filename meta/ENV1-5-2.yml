  The "Crop Diversity Index with a Focus on Fruit and Vegetables (Average Number
  of Varieties Planted of Crops by Province)" indicator measures the average
  number of different crop varieties, particularly fruits and vegetables,
  planted across provinces. This index reflects the level of biodiversity in
  agricultural practices within each province and focuses on the variety of
  crops being cultivated to ensure a diverse and resilient food system
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the diversity of crop varieties grown, with an emphasis
  on fruits and vegetables, across different provinces. Crop diversity is a
  crucial aspect of agricultural sustainability, as it enhances ecosystem
  resilience, supports food security, and reduces the risks associated with
  monoculture practices. By focusing on the number of different varieties
  planted, the indicator provides insights into the richness of agricultural
  biodiversity and the extent to which different crop varieties are being
  preserved and utilized.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the crop diversity index is essential for promoting sustainable
  agriculture and ensuring food security. A diverse range of crops, especially
  fruits and vegetables, contributes to a balanced diet, supports environmental
  health, and reduces vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate change. High
  crop diversity can also improve soil fertility and provide economic benefits
  by offering a broader range of marketable products. It also supports food
  security by ensuring a variety of food sources and contributes to nutritional
  diversity, which is important for public health.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Crop Diversity Index with a Focus on Fruit and Vegetables
  (Average Number of Varieties Planted of Crops by Province)," first collect
  data on the number of different varieties of fruit and vegetable crops planted
  within each province. Then, calculate the average number of varieties by
  summing the total number of different varieties planted and dividing by the
  total number of crops reported. Aggregate the data by province to obtain the
  average number of crop varieties planted per province.


  Formula:

  Crop Diversity Index (Average Number of Varieties) = Total Number of Different
  Fruit and Vegetable Varieties Planted/Total Number of Crops Planted
