  The "Average Annual Household Income from Tourism" indicator measures the
  average income earned by households from tourism-related activities and
  businesses over the course of a year. This income may come from various
  sources, such as providing accommodation, food services, transportation,
  guiding services, or selling goods and services to tourists.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the economic benefits that households derive from the
  tourism industry. Tourism can be a significant source of income, particularly
  in regions that attract a large number of visitors. The indicator provides
  insight into how tourism contributes to household income, which is important
  for understanding the broader economic impact of the tourism sector on local
  communities. The income measured includes direct earnings from tourism-related
  jobs, self-employment in tourism, and income from tourism-dependent businesses
  operated by households.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the average annual household income from tourism is crucial for
  assessing the economic impact of the tourism sector on local communities and
  households. A higher average income from tourism indicates that the sector is
  providing substantial economic benefits to the population, contributing to
  poverty alleviation, economic growth, and improved living standards.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To calculate the average annual household income from tourism, data is
  collected on the income earned by individual households engaged in
  tourism-related activities. This data is then aggregated to determine the
  total income from tourism for all households in the area. This total is
  divided by the number of households to derive the average income figure.
