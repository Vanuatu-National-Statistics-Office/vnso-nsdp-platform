  are filled by employees with long-term contracts or tenured status, as opposed
  to temporary, acting, or contract-based roles.

  typically include roles in administration, finance, human resources,
  information technology, and other essential management areas that support the

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the percentage of corporate positions filled on a permanent basis
  is essential for assessing the organizational strength and stability of the
  Ministry of Health. High levels of permanent staffing in corporate roles
  contribute to institutional memory, continuity of operations, and the
  effective execution of health sector strategies. Conversely, a high reliance
  on temporary or acting staff may indicate potential vulnerabilities in
  leadership and management, which can affect the Ministry’s ability to deliver
  health services effectively.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Percentage of Corporate Positions within Ministry of Health
  (MoH) Filled on a Permanent Basis," first identify and list all corporate
  positions within the Ministry. Then, collect data on how many of these
  positions are filled by permanent staff members. Next, divide the number of
  corporate positions filled by permanent staff by the total number of corporate
  positions. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.


  Formula:

  Percentage of Corporate Positions Filled on Permanent Basis (%) = (Number of
  Permanent Corporate Positions/Total Number of Corporate Positions) * 100
