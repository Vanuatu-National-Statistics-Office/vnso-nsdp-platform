  The "Ratio of Processed Export Commodities Including Coconut, Kava, Cocoa,
  Coffee to Raw Exports" indicator measures the proportion of value-added,
  processed export commodities to raw, unprocessed export commodities within a
  given period, typically expressed as a ratio. This indicator focuses on key
  agricultural products such as coconut, kava, cocoa, and coffee, comparing the
  volume or value of these commodities that have undergone processing before
  export to those exported in their raw form.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the level of value addition in the export of key
  agricultural commodities. Processing raw agricultural products before export
  can significantly enhance their value, increase revenue, and create additional
  employment opportunities within the country. The ratio of processed to raw
  exports reflects the extent to which the economy is moving up the value chain
  in agricultural production, shifting from being a supplier of raw materials to
  a producer of higher-value goods.
Disaggregation: Type of commodity
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the ratio of processed export commodities to raw exports is crucial
  for understanding the progress of industrialization and economic
  diversification within the agricultural sector. A higher ratio indicates a
  greater emphasis on value addition, which can lead to higher export revenues,
  better market positioning, and reduced vulnerability to fluctuations in raw
  commodity prices.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Ratio of Processed Export Commodities to Raw Exports," first
  gather data on the total value of processed export commodities, such as
  coconut oil, kava extracts, cocoa powder, and roasted coffee. Then, collect
  data on the total value of raw exports for the same commodities, such as raw
  coconut, unprocessed kava, raw cocoa beans, and green coffee beans. Finally,
  divide the total value of processed exports by the total value of raw exports,
  and express the result as a ratio.


  Formula:

  Ratio of Processed to Raw Exports= Total Value of Processed Exports/Total
  Value of Raw Exports
