  The "Proportion of Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity Development
  Strategy 2017-2020 Implemented" indicator measures the percentage of planned
  activities and initiatives outlined in the Justice and Community Services
  Sector Capacity Development Strategy 2017-2020 that have been successfully
  executed. This includes projects, programs, and reforms aimed at building
  capacity within the justice and community services sectors.

  This indicator tracks the progress made in implementing the strategic
  initiatives designed to enhance the capacity of the justice and community
  services sectors. Capacity development in this context refers to strengthening
  the skills, competencies, and abilities of individuals, institutions, and
  systems within these sectors to deliver effective and equitable services to
  the public.
Disaggregation: Activity type
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the strategy implemented is crucial for assessing
  the effectiveness of the Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity
  Development Strategy 2017-2020. A high proportion indicates successful
  execution of planned activities, contributing to improved service delivery,
  better governance, and enhanced access to justice and community services.
  Conversely, a low proportion may signal challenges such as resource
  constraints, lack of coordination, or other barriers to implementation.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Justice and Community Services Sector Capacity
  Development Strategy 2017-2020 Implemented," first identify and list all
  planned activities and initiatives detailed in the strategy. Then, collect
  data on the number of these activities that have been fully or partially
  implemented during the specified period. Next, divide the number of
  implemented activities by the total number of planned activities. Finally,
  multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of the strategy
  implemented as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Strategy Implemented (%) = (Number of Fully Implemented
  Activities/Total Number of Planned Activities) * 100
