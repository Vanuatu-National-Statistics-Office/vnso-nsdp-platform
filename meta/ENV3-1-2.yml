MethodOfComputation: >
  Method of computation:

  To compute the progress in "Institutional Strengthening of National Advisory
  Board (NAB), Department of Climate Change, and Other MoCC Departments," first
  identify the key activities and initiatives planned for institutional
  strengthening. Then, assess the progress of these activities by determining
  how many have been fully implemented. Calculate the progress by dividing the
  number of fully implemented activities by the total number of planned
  activities, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Institutional Strengthening Progress (%) = (Number of Strengthening Activities
  Fully Implemented/Total Number of Planned Strengthening Activities) * 100
