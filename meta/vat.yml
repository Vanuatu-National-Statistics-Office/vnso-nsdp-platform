Definition: >-
  The indicator “Value Added Tax (VAT) Collected by Major Industry” measures the
  total Value Added Tax (VAT) collected from registered businesses,
  disaggregated by major industry groups. It captures the contribution of each
  sector to total VAT revenue collected by the Department of Customs and Inland
  Revenue.
Concept: >-
  This indicator reflects the concept of domestic revenue mobilisation through
  indirect taxation, specifically VAT. VAT is a consumption tax levied on the
  value added to goods and services at each stage of production or distribution.
  As a broad-based tax, it is a major source of government revenue and a key
  instrument for financing public expenditure. Disaggregating VAT by industry
  supports analysis of the economic structure, sectoral tax compliance, and the
  relative productivity of different sectors in contributing to the tax base.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  Tracking VAT collected by industry provides valuable insights into the
  distribution of taxable economic activity across sectors. It helps identify
  which industries are contributing most to public finances and can signal areas
  where compliance is strong or where enforcement may need to be strengthened.
  Trends over time can reveal structural shifts in the economy or the impact of
  tax policy changes. High VAT collection in certain sectors may indicate robust
  consumer activity, while low figures in others may reflect informal practices
  or underreporting.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Aggregate the total VAT collected for each major industry group, based on
  reported VAT returns, and recorded transactions from VAT-registered
  businesses. Include both domestic and import-based VAT where relevant,
  ensuring values are net of refunds.
