Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Rural Households Engaged in Trade with Family in Urban
  Centres" indicator measures the percentage of rural households that
  participate in trade activities with their family members living in urban
  centres. This trade may involve the exchange or sale of goods, agricultural
  products, handicrafts, or services between rural households and their
  urban-based family members.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the extent of economic and social linkages between rural
  and urban areas through family-based trade activities. These interactions are
  important for the flow of goods, money, and information between rural and
  urban communities, helping to sustain livelihoods, support rural economies,
  and provide urban households with access to rural products. The indicator
  sheds light on the economic interdependence between rural and urban areas and
  the role of family networks in facilitating trade and economic activity.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of rural households engaged in trade with family
  members in urban centres is essential for understanding the dynamics of
  rural-urban economic relationships. Such trade can be a critical source of
  income for rural households and can help diversify their economic activities.
  It also supports urban families by providing access to fresh, locally produced
  goods, which may not be readily available in urban markets.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the "Proportion of Rural Households Engaged in Trade with Family in
  Urban Centres," first collect data on the number of rural households that
  participate in trade with their family members in urban centres. Then, obtain
  the total number of rural households in the area of study. Calculate the
  proportion by dividing the number of rural households engaged in trade by the
  total number of rural households, and multiply by 100 to express it as a
  percentage.
