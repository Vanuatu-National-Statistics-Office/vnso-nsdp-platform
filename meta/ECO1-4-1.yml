  Monitoring the value and volume of international trade is crucial for

  value of trade helps assess the financial impact of trade activities on the
  economy, while the volume of trade offers insights into the physical scale and
  demand for goods.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Value and Volume of International Trade/Merchandise Trade,"
  first collect data on the total monetary value of exports of goods for the
  reporting period from sources such as customs authorities or trade databases.
  Then, collect data on the physical quantity of goods traded during the same
  period, measured in metric tons or other relevant units. Aggregate the data
  for exports to obtain the total trade value and volume.


  Formula: 

  Total Trade Value=Total Value of Exports

  Total Trade Volume=Total Volume of Exports
