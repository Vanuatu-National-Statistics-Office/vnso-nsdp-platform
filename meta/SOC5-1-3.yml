  The "Average Cost of Legal Fees/Services for a Court Case" indicator measures
  the average amount of money that individuals or entities spend on legal fees
  and related services to pursue or defend a case in court. This includes
  payments to lawyers, court fees, expert witness fees, and other associated
  legal expenses.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the financial burden associated with accessing legal
  services in the court system. Legal fees can vary widely depending on the
  complexity of the case, the jurisdiction, the lawyer's experience, and other
  factors. Understanding the average cost provides insight into the
  affordability and accessibility of legal representation, which is a key
  component of the right to fair and equal access to justice.
Disaggregation: 'Case type (criminal, civil, family, etc)'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the average cost of legal fees and services is crucial for
  assessing the affordability of the judicial system for the general population.
  High legal costs can be a significant barrier to justice, especially for
  low-income individuals and marginalized groups.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Average Cost of Legal Fees/Services for a Court Case," first
  collect data on the legal fees and associated costs for a representative
  sample of court cases. Classify the data by type of case and jurisdiction to
  account for cost variations. Then, sum the total legal costs for all sampled
  cases and divide by the total number of cases to determine the average cost.
  This provides insight into the financial burden of accessing legal services in
  the court system.



  Formula:

  Average Cost of Legal Fees/Services = (Total Legal Fees/Service Costs for All
  Cases/Total Number of Cases)
