  The "Total Annual Number of New Businesses Registered by Type" indicator
  measures the total count of new businesses officially registered within a
  country or region during a given year, categorized by the type of business
  entity. Business types may include sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited
  liability companies (LLCs), corporations, cooperatives, and other legal forms
  of business organization.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the entrepreneurial activity and business formation
  within an economy by recording the number of new businesses registered and
  categorizing them by their legal structure. The type of business entity chosen
  by entrepreneurs can reflect the nature of the business, the level of
  investment, the number of stakeholders involved, and the regulatory
  requirements they must meet. By categorizing new businesses by type, the
  indicator provides insights into the diversity and dynamism of the business
  landscape.

  crucial for understanding the entrepreneurial climate, the ease of doing

  allows policymakers and economic analysts to assess trends in business
  formation, identify which sectors or types of businesses are experiencing
  growth, and evaluate the impact of regulatory frameworks on different types of
  enterprises.

  total number of new businesses registered for each type to obtain a count of
  new registrations by business type.
