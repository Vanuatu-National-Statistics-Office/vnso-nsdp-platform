Definition: >-
  The "Number of Anti-Corruption Committee Submissions Acted Upon" indicator
  measures the total number of reports, recommendations, or submissions made by
  an anti-corruption committee that have resulted in concrete actions or
  responses by relevant authorities or institutions. This includes
  investigations, policy changes, disciplinary actions, or any other formal
  response triggered by the committee's submissions.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the effectiveness and impact of an anti-corruption
  committee in addressing corruption issues. Anti-corruption committees
  typically receive reports, investigate allegations, and make recommendations
  for action to combat corruption. The indicator reflects the extent to which
  these efforts lead to tangible outcomes, such as legal proceedings, reforms,
  or other corrective measures.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of anti-corruption committee submissions acted upon is
  crucial for assessing the responsiveness of the government and other relevant
  bodies to corruption-related issues. A higher number of submissions acted upon
  indicates that the committee's work is leading to concrete actions and
  potentially reducing corruption. Conversely, a low number may suggest that the
  committee's recommendations are not being taken seriously or that there are
  barriers to implementing anti-corruption measures.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Anti-Corruption Committee Submissions Acted Upon,"
  first identify and list all submissions made by the anti-corruption committee
  within the specified time period. Then, collect data on the number of these
  submissions that have resulted in concrete actions by relevant authorities or
  institutions. Finally, count the total number of submissions that have been
  acted upon to determine the indicator value.



  Formula:

  Number of ACC Submissions Acted Upon = Sum of All Submissions Resulting in
  Actions
