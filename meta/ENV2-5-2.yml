Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Environmental Obligations Within International Conventions
  and Treaties Met" indicator measures the percentage of environmental
  commitments and obligations that a country has fulfilled under various
  international conventions and treaties to which it is a signatory. This
  indicator reflects the country’s compliance with its international
  environmental responsibilities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the fulfilment of a country’s environmental obligations
  under international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on climate change,
  the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Basel Convention on hazardous
  wastes, and others. These obligations may include reporting requirements,
  implementation of specific environmental policies, reduction targets,
  conservation efforts, and other commitments. The indicator provides insights
  into how effectively a country is adhering to its international environmental
  commitments and contributing to global environmental goals.

Rationale: >-
  This Study will try to depict the proportion of environmental obligations
  within the international convention and treaties that are being met inside
  Vanuatu. The data collected will be analysed to measure the progress of
  environmental institutions and its governance towards meeting national and
  international standards. To determine whether or not Vanuatu’s economy can
  foster sustainable growth and development through low impact industries and
  modern technologies to ensure the well-being of future generations.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Environmental Obligations Within International
  Conventions and Treaties Met," first identify and list all the environmental
  obligations and commitments the country has under the international
  conventions and treaties it has ratified. Then, assess the country’s
  compliance with each obligation to determine whether it has been fully met,
  partially met, or not met. Next, divide the number of fully met obligations by
  the total number of obligations identified. Finally, multiply the result by
  100 to express the proportion of obligations met as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Proportion of Obligations Met (%) = (Number of Fully Met Obligations/Total
  Number of Obligations Within Conventions and Treaties) * 100
