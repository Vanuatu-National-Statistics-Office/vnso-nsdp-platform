  The "Number of Model Schools Implementing Environmental Programmes" indicator
  measures the total count of schools designated as "model schools" that have
  integrated and are actively running environmental education programs within
  their curriculum or as extracurricular activities. These programs focus on
  promoting environmental awareness, sustainability, and conservation practices
  among students.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the adoption and implementation of environmental
  programs in model schools, which are schools recognized for their exemplary
  educational practices. Environmental programs in these schools may include
  activities such as recycling projects, school gardens, environmental clubs,
  energy conservation initiatives, and curriculum-based lessons on
  sustainability and ecological stewardship. The indicator reflects the role of
  education in fostering environmental consciousness and responsible behaviour
  among young people.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of model schools implementing environmental programs is
  crucial for evaluating the impact of educational initiatives on environmental
  awareness and action. Schools play a vital role in shaping the attitudes and
  behaviours of future generations, and integrating environmental education into
  school programs is essential for promoting a culture of sustainability.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Model Schools Implementing Environmental Programs,"
  first identify all the schools designated as model schools within the
  educational system. Verify whether these schools have actively integrated and
  implemented environmental programs by reviewing relevant documentation. Then,
  count the total number of model schools that have successfully implemented
  such programs within the reporting period.


  Formula:

  Total Number of Model Schools Implementing Environmental Programs = Sum of All
  Verified Model Schools with Environmental Programs
