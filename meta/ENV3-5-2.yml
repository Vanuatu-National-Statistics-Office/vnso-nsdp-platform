Definition: >-
  The "Number of Climate and Disaster Finance Funds to Which Vanuatu is Formally
  Accredited" indicator measures the total count of international and regional
  climate and disaster finance funds to which Vanuatu has gained formal
  accreditation. Accreditation typically means that Vanuatu is recognized as an
  eligible entity to access and manage financial resources provided by these
  funds to support climate change adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk
  management projects.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks Vanuatu's ability to engage with and access financial
  resources from various climate and disaster finance mechanisms. Accreditation
  is often required for a country to directly receive and manage funds from
  international finance bodies, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Adaptation
  Fund, or other regional disaster risk management funds. The indicator reflects
  the country's readiness and capacity to participate in global and regional
  financial mechanisms that support climate resilience and disaster
  preparedness.
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the number of climate and disaster finance funds to which Vanuatu
  is formally accredited is important for understanding the country’s access to
  critical financial resources needed for climate change adaptation and disaster
  risk management. Accreditation allows Vanuatu to secure funding for national
  and community-level projects that address environmental vulnerabilities and
  enhance resilience.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Number of Climate and Disaster Finance Funds to Which Vanuatu
  is Formally Accredited," first identify and list all relevant international
  and regional climate and disaster finance funds that offer accreditation.
  Then, verify whether Vanuatu has achieved formal accreditation for each of
  these funds. Finally, count the total number of funds to which Vanuatu is
  formally accredited.



  Formula:

  Total Number of Accredited Funds = Sum of All Climate and Disaster Finance
  Funds to Which Vanuatu is Accredited
