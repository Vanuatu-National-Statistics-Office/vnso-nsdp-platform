  The "Total Fishing Aggregated Devices (FADs) per 1,000 Population by Province"
  indicator measures the number of Fishing Aggregated Devices (FADs) available
  within a province, normalized by the population size, expressed as the number
  of FADs per 1,000 people. FADs are man-made objects used to attract fish,
  making it easier for fishermen to locate and catch fish.
Concept: >-
  This indicator provides insight into the distribution and availability of
  fishing resources, specifically FADs, across different provinces. FADs are
  critical tools in sustainable fisheries management, as they help concentrate
  fish in specific areas, making fishing more efficient and potentially reducing
  overfishing in other regions. By normalizing the number of FADs to the
  population size, this indicator helps to assess whether the deployment of FADs
  is equitable across regions relative to the population that depends on them.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the total number of FADs per 1,000 population by province is
  essential for ensuring equitable access to fishing resources, supporting local
  livelihoods, and promoting sustainable fishing practices. FADs play a crucial
  role in supporting artisanal and commercial fishing, which are vital for food
  security, income generation, and cultural practices in many coastal
  communities. A higher number of FADs per capita may indicate better access to
  fishing resources, which can support local livelihoods, enhance food security,
  and contribute to the local economy. Conversely, a lower number may suggest
  limited access to fishing resources, which could impact the sustainability of
  local fisheries and the well-being of fishing communities.
MethodOfComputation: >
  Method of computation:

  To compute the "Total Fishing Aggregated Devices (FADs) per 1,000 Population
  by Province," first collect data on the total number of FADs deployed in each
  province. Then, obtain the total population of each province. Calculate the
  number of FADs per 1,000 population by dividing the total number of FADs by
  the population size and multiplying by 1,000.


  Formula:

  FADs per 1,000 Population= (Total Number of FADs in Province/Total Population
  of Province)
