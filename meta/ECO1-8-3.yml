Definition: >-
  The "Deposit Ratios" indicator measures the proportion of total deposits held
  by financial institutions, such as banks, relative to their total liabilities
  or assets. This ratio provides insight into the stability, liquidity, and risk
  management practices of financial institutions by indicating the extent to
  which their operations are funded by deposits.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the relationship between deposits—funds placed in banks
  or financial institutions by individuals, businesses, and other entities—and
  the broader financial operations of these institutions. The deposit ratio is
  typically expressed as a percentage and can be calculated in various forms,
  such as the loan-to-deposit ratio (which compares loans to deposits) or the
  deposit-to-liability ratio (which compares deposits to total liabilities). The
  ratio is a key measure of a financial institution's liquidity and its ability
  to meet withdrawal demands from depositors.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring deposit ratios is crucial for assessing the financial health and
  stability of banking institutions. A high deposit ratio suggests that a
  significant portion of a bank's funding comes from deposits, which is
  generally seen as a stable and reliable source of funds. Conversely, a low
  deposit ratio might indicate a reliance on more volatile or expensive sources
  of funding, potentially increasing the institution's risk profile.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute "Deposit Ratios," first collect data on the total amount of
  deposits held by financial institutions, as well as their total liabilities or
  assets, depending on the specific ratio being calculated. For the
  loan-to-deposit ratio, divide total loans by total deposits and multiply by
  100 to express it as a percentage. For the deposit-to-liability or
  deposit-to-asset ratios, divide total deposits by total liabilities or assets,
  respectively, and multiply by 100.


  Formula:

  Loan to Deposit Ratio= (Total Loans/Total Deposits)*100

  Deposit to Liability Ratio= (Total Deposits/Total Liabilities)*100

  Deposit to Asset Ratio= (Total Deposits/Total Assets)*100
