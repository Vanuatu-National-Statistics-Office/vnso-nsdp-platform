Definition: >-
  The "Proportion of Eligible Population Reporting to Have Voted in Last
  Election" indicator measures the percentage of individuals within the eligible
  voting population who report that they participated in the most recent
  election. This self-reported data is typically collected through post-election
  surveys or censuses.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks voter participation, which is a key measure of
  democratic engagement and civic responsibility. The eligible population refers
  to individuals who meet the legal requirements to vote, including age,
  citizenship, and any other criteria specific to the country or region. The
  indicator provides insights into the level of public involvement in the
  electoral process and can highlight the health of a democracy.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the eligible population that reports having voted
  is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the electoral process, the
  accessibility of voting, and the public’s engagement with democratic
  institutions. High voter turnout generally reflects a strong interest in the
  political process and confidence in the electoral system. Conversely, low
  turnout may indicate barriers to voting, apathy, or disillusionment with the
  political system.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Eligible Population Reporting to Have Voted in
  the Last Election," collect data on the number of eligible voters who reported
  voting in the most recent election through surveys or electoral records.
  Divide this number by the total eligible population, then multiply by 100 to
  express the result as a percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Eligible Voters Reporting Participation (%) = (Number of
  Eligible Voters Reporting to Have Voted/Total Number of Eligible Voters) * 100
