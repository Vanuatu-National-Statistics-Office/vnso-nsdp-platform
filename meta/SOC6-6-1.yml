  The "Proportion of Declared Physical Planning Areas That Have a Physical Plan"
  indicator measures the percentage of officially designated physical planning
  areas that have developed and implemented a formal physical plan. A physical
  plan typically includes detailed land use, zoning, infrastructure, and
  development guidelines aimed at managing growth and ensuring sustainable
  development within the area.
Concept: >-
  This indicator tracks the progress of urban and regional planning efforts by
  assessing the extent to which declared physical planning areas have formalized
  their development strategies through physical plans. Physical planning areas
  are regions designated by governmental authorities as needing specific
  planning controls to guide development, manage land use, and ensure the
  sustainable and organized growth of urban, suburban, or rural areas.
Disaggregation: Region
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of declared physical planning areas that have an
  established physical plan is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of land
  use planning and management. The presence of a physical plan indicates that
  the area has a clear framework for development, which helps to prevent
  uncoordinated growth, reduce conflicts over land use, and protect
  environmental resources. A higher proportion reflects proactive planning and
  governance, contributing to sustainable urban and rural development.
  Conversely, a lower proportion may suggest gaps in planning capacity, lack of
  resources, or challenges in the implementation of planning policies.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Proportion of Declared Physical Planning Areas That Have a
  Physical Plan," first identify and list all areas that have been officially
  designated as physical planning areas. Then, collect data on how many of these
  areas have developed and implemented a physical plan. Divide the number of
  areas with a physical plan by the total number of declared physical planning
  areas, and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a
  percentage.



  Formula:

  Proportion of Areas with Physical Plans (%) = (Number of Declared Areas with
  Physical Plans/Total Number of Declared Physical Planning Areas) * 100
