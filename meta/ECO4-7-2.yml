Definition: >-
  The "Labour Market Flows" indicator measures the movements of individuals into
  and out of employment, unemployment, and the labour force over a specific
  period. These flows include transitions between employment, unemployment, and
  inactivity (people not actively seeking work), providing a dynamic view of
  labour market activity.
Concept: >-
  This indicator captures the fluidity and dynamics of the labour market by
  tracking the rates at which people enter or exit employment, move between
  jobs, become unemployed, or leave the labour force altogether. Labour market
  flows are crucial for understanding the underlying factors affecting
  employment levels, such as economic conditions, job creation, layoffs, and
  labour force participation rates. The indicator helps to assess the stability
  of the labour market, the effectiveness of job matching processes, and the
  responsiveness of the labour market to economic changes.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring labour market flows is essential for gaining insights into the
  health and efficiency of the labour market. High flows into employment can
  indicate strong job creation and economic growth, while high flows into
  unemployment may signal economic distress or inefficiencies in the labour
  market. Similarly, tracking flows out of the labour force can provide
  information on discouraged workers or changing demographics.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute "Labour Market Flows," first collect data on the number of
  individuals transitioning between employment, unemployment, and out of the
  labour force over a specified period. Classify these transitions into flow
  categories such as Employment to Unemployment or Unemployment to Employment.
  Calculate the flow rates by dividing the number of individuals in each flow
  category by the total labour market population and multiply by 100 to express
  it as a percentage.


  Formula:

  Flow Rate (%) = (Number of Individuals in Flow Category/Total Number of
  Individuals in the Labour Market) * 100
