Definition: >-
  The "Amount of Climate and Disaster Finance Used for Community Programs and
  Activities Through External Support" indicator measures the total financial
  resources obtained from external sources (such as international donors,
  multilateral funds, or bilateral agreements) that are allocated and spent on
  community-level programs and activities aimed at climate change adaptation,
  mitigation, and disaster risk management. This includes funding for
  initiatives that directly benefit local communities, such as infrastructure
  projects, capacity-building efforts, and resilience-building activities.
Concept: >-
  This indicator focuses on the financial resources sourced externally that are
  dedicated to supporting community-level climate and disaster-related
  activities. External support may come from a variety of sources, including
  international climate finance mechanisms (like the Green Climate Fund),
  bilateral donors, non-governmental organizations, or private sector
  contributions. The indicator tracks the flow of these funds from their source
  to the specific programs and activities at the community level, highlighting
  the impact of international and regional financial contributions on local
  climate and disaster resilience efforts
Disaggregation: Sector
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the amount of climate and disaster finance used for community
  programs through external support is essential for understanding the level of
  international and regional engagement in supporting grassroots initiatives.
  Community-based programs are crucial for building local resilience to climate
  change and disasters, as they directly address the needs and vulnerabilities
  of the most affected populations.
MethodOfComputation: >
  To compute the "Amount of Climate and Disaster Finance Used for Community
  Programs and Activities Through External Support," first identify all external
  funding sources that provide financial resources for climate change and
  disaster management activities at the community level. Track the allocation of
  these funds to specific community programs and activities, confirming their
  use through financial reports and project documentation. Calculate the total
  amount of external funds used by summing the resources allocated and spent on
  these initiatives within the reporting period.



  Formula:

  Total Amount of Climate and Disaster Finance Used = Sum of All External Funds
  Allocated to Community Programs and Activities
