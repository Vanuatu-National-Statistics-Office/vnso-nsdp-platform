It captures how people perceive the quality of their lives based on their own experiences, emotions, and expectations.","Concept":"Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to how people experience and evaluate their lives and specific domains and activities within them. Unlike objective measures of well-being (such as income, health status, or employment), subjective well-being focuses on individuals' personal perceptions and feelings. It typically encompasses several dimensions, including life satisfaction (cognitive evaluations of life), emotional well-being (presence of positive emotions and absence of negative emotions), and a sense of purpose or meaning in life.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring subjective well-being is essential for understanding the broader picture of human welfare beyond material and economic conditions. High levels of subjective well-being are associated with better health outcomes, productivity, and social cohesion. By capturing how people feel about their lives, this indicator provides valuable insights into the population's mental and emotional health, the effectiveness of social policies, and the overall quality of life.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Subjective Well-Being Indicator,\" collect data through surveys where respondents rate their life satisfaction and emotional well-being on a numerical scale. Calculate the average subjective well-being score by summing the individual well-being scores and dividing by the total number of respondents. The average score provides a measure of the population's perceived well-being, offering insights into mental health, happiness, and life satisfaction.\n\nFormula:\nAverage Subjective Well-Being Score = (Sum of All Individual Well-Being Scores/Total Number of Respondents)\n","SDGAlignment":"5.1.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Average score","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-21","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Subjective Well-being indicator","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-02-01"}
