Compliance means that the projects have undergone the EIA process, received approval, and are implementing the recommended environmental management and mitigation measures.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the adherence of development projects to environmental regulations through the completion and compliance with Environmental Impact Assessments. The EIA is a critical tool used to evaluate the potential environmental effects of a proposed project before it proceeds. It ensures that environmental considerations are integrated into the decision-making process, helping to prevent or minimize negative environmental impacts. The indicator provides insights into how well development projects are aligning with environmental sustainability standards.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of development projects complying with EIA requirements is essential for promoting sustainable development and protecting the environment. Compliance with EIA requirements ensures that potential environmental risks are identified and addressed, which helps to prevent environmental degradation and promotes responsible development. This indicator helps policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public understand the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks in ensuring that development activities are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Development Projects Complying with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Requirements,\" first collect data on all development projects that have been subjected to EIA requirements within the specified period. Then, verify which of these projects have fully complied with the EIA process, including completing the EIA report, obtaining approval from relevant authorities, and implementing the recommended environmental management and mitigation measures. Finally, count the total number of projects that have complied with all EIA requirements.\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Compliant Projects = Total Development Projects Complying with EIA Requirements \n","SDGAlignment":"11.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Number of development projects complying with EIA requirements","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-02-01"}
