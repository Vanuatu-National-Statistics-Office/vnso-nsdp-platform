As a developing country labor statistics can play a crucial role in shaping the country's development goals. Here are some of the  significant  labor statistics in Vanuatu and how they can help the country achieve its development goals.\n\n1. Low employment rate\nVanuatu has a low employment rate of around 31%, and this can be seen as significant challenge  towards the country's development. this low employment rate can result  in limited job opportunities, lack of skills, or low education levels. To address this challenge, Vanuatu needs to invest in creating a conducive environment for businesses to grow, promoting entrepreneurship, and equipping the workforce with the  necessary skills for current labor market needs.\n\n2.High youth unemployment\nVanuatu also has a high youth unemployment rate of around 26%. Youth make up a significant portion of the population, and addressing their unemployment challenges is critical to the country's development. Encouraging entrepreneurship, vocational training, and promoting industries that can hire  and engage the youth can address this challenge.\n\n3.Informal sector dominance\nAround 80% of Vanuatu workforce is engaged in the informal sector, which often comes with low wages, limited job security, and poor working conditions. The government of Vanuatu can promote an enabling business environment, implement policies aimed at formalizing the informal sector, and offer incentives to the sector's actors to reduce the dominance of the informal sector in the economy.\n\n4.Gender gap\nVanuatu labor market experiences gender  gaps with women underrepresented in high-earning jobs or formal employment. Promoting gender equality, enacting laws that promote women's inclusion in the workforce, and creating awareness of gender disparities in the labor market can help bridge this gap.\n\nTherefore labor statistics play a crucial role in informing the country's development goals. Addressing the employment, youth employment, informal sector dominance, and gender equality may help Vanuatu bridge the economic disparities that deny many citizens access to essentials services and uplift their standards of  living.\n\n\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"labor","goal_number":"labor","indicator_sort_order":"labor"},"SOC3-3-3":{"indicator_number":"SOC3-3-3","goal_number":"SOC3","goal_name":"A healthy population that enjoys a high quality of physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being","target_number":"SOC3-3","target_name":"Promote healthy lifestyle choices and health seeking behaviour to improve population health and well-being","indicator_name":"Under 5 mortality rate","PillarCode":"SOC","PillarDescription":"Society Pillar","GoalId":"SOC3","GoalDescription":"A healthy population that enjoys a high quality of physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being","PolicyObjectiveId":"SOC3-3","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"Promote healthy lifestyle choices and health seeking behaviour to improve population health and well-being","IndicatorId":"SOC3-3-3","IndicatorDescription":"Under 5 mortality rate","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"No","Definition":"The \"Under-5 Mortality Rate\" indicator measures the probability that a child born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five, expressed per 1,000 live births.

Assessment Administration: Students are assessed using various evaluation methods, such as standardized tests, examinations, or assessments specifically designed to measure literacy and numeracy skills. These assessments are typically administered to all registered students throughout the entire country.\n\n3. Scoring and Proficiency Determination: The assessment results are scored based on predetermined scoring rubrics or criteria that align with the established standards. The scores provide a measure of each student's proficiency level in literacy and numeracy skills both in English & French.\n\n4. Calculation of Percentage: The percentage of students meeting the literacy and numeracy standards is computed by determining the proportion of students who achieve or exceed the proficiency benchmark. This is done by dividing the number of students who meet the standards by the total number of students assessed and multiplying the result by 100.\n\n5. Reporting and Analysis: The computed percentage is reported to stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and the public. It is often disaggregated by grade level, school, district, or other relevant demographics to identify variations and disparities in student performance.\n\nBy employing this computation method, education authorities can track the progress of students' literacy and numeracy skills over time, identify areas in need of improvement, and inform targeted interventions and policies to enhance educational outcomes in these fundamental areas.","SDGAlignment":"4.2, 4.2.1 (R) (Tier 2) & 4.3, 4.3.1 (Tier 2)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2016 - 202021  Annual Statistical Digest - MoE (Meeting and Exceeding Standard)","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-14","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"SOC2-03-01","graph_title":"global_indicators.SOC2-3-1-title"},"ECO1-8-3":{"indicator_number":"ECO1-8-3","goal_number":"ECO1","goal_name":"A stable and prosperous economy, encouraging trade, investment and providing economic opportunities for all members of society throughout Vanuatu","target_number":"ECO1-8","target_name":"Ensure financial sector stability and make financial services affordable and accessible for all through pursuing financial inclusion strategies","indicator_name":"Deposit ratios","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"Economy Pillar","GoalId":"ECO1","GoalDescription":"A stable and prosperous economy, encouraging trade, investment and providing economic opportunities for all members of society throughout Vanuatu","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO1-8","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"Ensure financial sector stability and make financial services affordable and accessible for all through pursuing financial inclusion strategies","IndicatorId":"ECO1-8-3","IndicatorDescription":"Deposit ratios","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"No","Definition":"The \"Deposit Ratios\" indicator measures the proportion of total deposits held by financial institutions, such as banks, relative to their total liabilities or assets.
