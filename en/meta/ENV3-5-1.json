This indicator reflects the extent to which government efforts in these areas are supported by external funding sources.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the reliance on external financial support from donor partners for government initiatives related to climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. Budget support refers to direct financial contributions provided by donor partners to the government, which are used to fund specific programs and activities aimed at enhancing climate resilience and reducing disaster risks. The indicator provides insights into the degree of international collaboration and financial support for the country\u2019s climate and disaster management strategies.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of spending on climate change adaptation and DRM that is funded by donor partners is crucial for understanding the financial sustainability and international support for these initiatives. External funding plays a significant role in enabling governments, particularly in developing countries, to implement large-scale adaptation and risk management programs that might otherwise be unaffordable.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Annual Spending on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management Funded with Budget Support from Donor Partners to the Government,\" first collect data on the total annual government expenditure on climate change adaptation and DRM. Then, gather data on the amount of budget support provided by donor partners for these purposes. Next, divide the amount of donor-funded budget support by the total government expenditure on climate change adaptation and DRM. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Spending Funded by Donors (%) = (Amount of Donor-Funded Budget Support/Total Annual Spending on Climate Change and DRM) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.a.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic Policy Planning & Aid Coordination","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of annual spending on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management funded with budget support from donor partners to the government","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-05-01"}
