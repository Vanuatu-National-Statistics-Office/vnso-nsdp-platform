These products include goods that have undergone value-added processing within the country, such as food items, beverages, textiles, and other manufactured goods derived from local raw materials.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the production volume of processed goods that originate from local raw materials and are either consumed domestically or exported. Processing local products adds value to raw materials, enhances the economic potential of local industries, and can contribute significantly to a country\u2019s GDP. The indicator provides insights into the capacity and growth of the local processing industry, the extent of value addition, and the potential of local products to compete in both domestic and international markets.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of processed local products produced per annum is crucial for understanding the development of the local processing industry and its contribution to the economy. A high production volume indicates a strong processing sector that adds value to raw materials, creates jobs, and generates income through domestic sales and exports.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of Processed Local Products Produced Per Annum for Domestic Consumption and Export,\" first collect data on the total production volumes of locally processed products for the year. Categorize the data based on whether the products are intended for domestic consumption or export. Sum the total number of processed products produced for both domestic and export markets to obtain the overall production figure for the year.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Processed Local Products= Total Processed Products for Domestic Consumption + Total Processed Products for Export","SDGAlignment":"9.b.1\n (Tier 2)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-31","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Total value in millions of vatu","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total number of processed local products produced per annum for domestic consumption and export","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-03-01"}
