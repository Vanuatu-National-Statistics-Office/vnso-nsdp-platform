{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cProjected Population by Sex, Age Group, and Province\u201d is the estimated number of individuals projected to reside in each province of Vanuatu, disaggregated by sex and 5-year age groups, for each year from 2020 to 2050.","Concept":"This indicator is based on the demographic concept of population projections, which are forward-looking estimates derived from the most recent census base population, adjusted using assumptions about future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration. It supports long-term planning, including infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social services, by estimating future population dynamics by region, age, and sex.","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Population projections provide critical insights for national and provincial policy and planning. Disaggregating the data by age and sex allows for assessment of demographic shifts, ageing trends, youth bulges, and population growth or decline in specific areas. These insights inform targeted investments, especially in health, education, and economic development.","MethodOfComputation":"Method of Computation: \nProjections are calculated using the cohort-component method, which applies age-specific fertility, mortality, and migration rates to a base year population. Each subsequent year's population is derived by aging the population forward and applying assumptions for births, deaths, and net migration.\n\nFormula: \nNot applicable \u2014 total projected population counts by age group, sex, and province are produced through demographic modelling, not a single formula.\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-23","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Population Growth ","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu projections","indicator_number":"population demographics","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"This standalone indicator basically provide information and data for population growth over the past decades.
