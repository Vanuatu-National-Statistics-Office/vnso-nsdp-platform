This rate reflects the cost of borrowing money from banks and the return on savings or deposits made with banks.\n\n ","Concept":"This indicator tracks the general level of interest rates within the banking sector, providing an average of the rates applied by banks to their lending and deposit-taking activities. The average bank rate is a critical component of a country\u2019s monetary policy environment and influences the overall cost of credit, investment decisions, and savings behaviour. It includes rates for various financial products, such as personal loans, mortgages, and savings accounts.","Disaggregation":"Bank","Rationale":"Monitoring the average bank interest rate level is essential for understanding the monetary conditions within an economy. Interest rates directly impact consumer spending, business investment, inflation, and economic growth. Higher interest rates typically reduce borrowing and spending, while lower rates encourage them.\n\n","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Interest Rate Level (Average Bank Rate),\" first collect interest rate data from a representative sample of commercial banks within the country, including rates for various types of loans and deposits. Then, calculate the average bank rate by summing the interest rates from the selected banks and dividing by the number of banks in the sample. If detailed data is available, compute a weighted average by considering the volume of loans or deposits associated with each rate.\n\nFormula:\nAverage Bank Rate= (Total Interest Rates from Selected Banks/Number of Banks in Sample)\n","SDGAlignment":"8.10.1 & 8.10.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Quarterly","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Interest Rate level (average bank rate)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-08-02"}
