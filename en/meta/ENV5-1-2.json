These guidelines may cover a wide range of environmental issues, including air and water quality, waste management, land use, biodiversity conservation, and pollution control.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the establishment of environmental guidelines that serve as frameworks or best practices for managing environmental impacts and ensuring sustainable development. Environmental guidelines are critical tools that provide specific instructions, standards, or recommendations to organizations, industries, and government bodies to minimize their environmental footprint, comply with regulations, and promote sustainability. The indicator reflects the commitment of a country or region to establishing a comprehensive set of rules and practices aimed at protecting the environment.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of environmental guidelines in place is essential for assessing the robustness of a country\u2019s or region\u2019s environmental governance framework. The existence of a wide range of guidelines indicates a proactive approach to environmental management, ensuring that various aspects of environmental protection are addressed systematically.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of Environmental Guidelines in Place,\" first identify and list all environmental guidelines that have been developed and officially implemented within the specified region or country. Then, verify that each guideline is officially in place and being enforced. Finally, count the total number of environmental guidelines that have been verified as being in place.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Environmental Guidelines in Place = Sum of All Verified Environmental Guidelines \n","SDGAlignment":"15.9.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Number","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total number of environmental guidelines in place","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV5-01-02"}
