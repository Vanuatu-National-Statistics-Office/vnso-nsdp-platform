This indicator reflects the extent to which these critical topics are being taught in the education system.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the adoption and implementation of educational content focused on climate change and disaster risk reduction within public schools. These modules are designed to educate students on the science of climate change, the importance of sustainability, and strategies to reduce disaster risks. By incorporating these topics into the national curriculum, the education system plays a crucial role in building a more informed and resilient future generation.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of public schools using climate change and DRR modules in the curriculum is essential for assessing the effectiveness of efforts to mainstream these topics into education. Teaching students about climate change and disaster risk reduction is key to raising awareness, fostering proactive attitudes, and equipping young people with the knowledge and skills needed to respond to and mitigate the impacts of environmental challenges.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Public Schools Using the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Modules in National Curriculum at All Levels,\" first identify all public schools that are part of the national education system. Assess whether these schools have integrated the climate change and disaster risk reduction modules into their curriculum across all levels of education. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of schools using the modules by the total number of public schools, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Schools Using CC & DRR Modules (%) = (Number of Public Schools Using the Modules / Total Number of Public Schools) \u00d7 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.3.1 & 13.3.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education & Training","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of multi-hazard and risk maps to improve Post-Disaster Needs Assessment","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-03-03"}
