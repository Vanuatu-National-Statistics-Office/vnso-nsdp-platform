This indicator reflects the distribution of tourism activity across different geographic areas, particularly the less accessible or more remote parts of the country.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which visitors explore beyond the main island or primary tourist hubs and visit outer islands. Outer islands often offer unique cultural, natural, and recreational experiences that differ from those available on the main island. By measuring the proportion of visitors who venture to these areas, the indicator provides insight into the appeal of outer islands as tourist destinations and the effectiveness of efforts to promote tourism in these regions. It also highlights the potential for spreading the economic benefits of tourism more evenly across the country.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of visitors traveling to outer islands is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution of tourism and its economic impact on different regions. A higher proportion of visitors traveling to outer islands indicates that tourism benefits are being distributed more widely, supporting local economies, preserving cultural heritage, and reducing pressure on the main island\u2019s infrastructure. Conversely, a lower proportion may suggest that more efforts are needed to promote these areas or improve access.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Visitors Traveling to Outer Islands,\" first collect data on the number of visitors who travel to outer islands during the reporting period and the total number of visitors to the country or region. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of visitors to outer islands by the total number of visitors, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Visitors Traveling to Outer Islands (%)= (Number of Visitors to Outer Islands/Total Number of Visitors)*100\n","SDGAlignment":"8.9.1\n8.9.2\n17.17.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs & Inland Revenue","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-31","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Total number of visitors","unit":"Total count","title":"Total number of visitors travelling to outer islands"},{"series":"proportion of visitors","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of visitors traveling to outer islands"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-02-03"}
