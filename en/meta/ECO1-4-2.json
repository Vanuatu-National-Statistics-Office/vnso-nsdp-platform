The current account balance reflects the difference between a country\u2019s savings and its investment, and it includes the trade balance (exports minus imports of goods and services), net income from abroad, and net current transfers (such as remittances).","Concept":"This indicator tracks the fluctuations in the current account balance, which is a critical measure of a country\u2019s economic transactions with the rest of the world. A positive current account balance (surplus) indicates that a country is a net lender to the rest of the world, while a negative balance (deficit) suggests that it is a net borrower. The change in the current account balance over time provides insights into the dynamics of international trade, investment income, and transfers, and helps assess the sustainability of a country\u2019s external position.","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Monitoring the change in the current account balance is essential for understanding a country\u2019s economic health and its ability to engage in international trade and financial activities. A significant improvement in the current account balance might indicate increased competitiveness, higher savings rates, or favorable terms of trade, while a worsening balance could signal economic vulnerabilities, such as excessive dependence on foreign capital or declining exports.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Current Accounts Balance Change,\" first collect data on the country\u2019s current account balance for the current period and the previous period. Then, calculate the change by subtracting the previous period\u2019s balance from the current period\u2019s balance. Express this change in absolute terms or as a percentage by dividing the change by the previous period\u2019s balance and multiplying by 100. This calculation provides insights into how the country\u2019s external economic position has evolved over time.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage Change in Current account Balance= (Current Account Balance (Current Year) \u2013 Current Account Balance (Previous Year)/ Current Account Balance (Previous Year))*100\n","SDGAlignment":"8.a.1\n17.12.1\n","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Quarterly ","source_organisation_1":"Reserve Bank of Vanuatu","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-07","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Current Accounts balance change","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-04-02"}
