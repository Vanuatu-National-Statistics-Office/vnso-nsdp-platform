Improved sanitation facilities include flush toilets, piped sewer systems, septic tanks, ventilated improved pit latrines, and other safe and hygienic means of disposing of human waste.","Concept":"The concept behind this indicator is to assess the progress and effectiveness of efforts to provide adequate sanitation services to the population. It considers factors such as the availability of improved sanitation facilities, their functionality, accessibility, and the practices and behaviors surrounding sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe significance of this indicator lies in its contribution to public health, hygiene promotion, and human well-being. Access to improved sanitation facilities plays a vital role in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases, reducing exposure to health risks, and maintaining a clean and healthy environment.","Disaggregation":"Region & Time Period","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population with reliable access to improved sanitation facilities is crucial for public health, environmental sustainability, and social well-being. Access to improved sanitation is a key factor in preventing the spread of waterborne and other communicable diseases, improving overall health outcomes, and enhancing the quality of life.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Reliable Access to Improved Sanitation Facilities,\" first collect data through surveys or censuses to determine the number of households or individuals with consistent and reliable access to improved sanitation facilities. Then, calculate the proportion by dividing this number by the total population or number of households surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.","SDGAlignment":"6.1.1\n6.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every five to ten years","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-01","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with reliable access to improved sanitation facilities","graph_titles":[{"series":"proportion of population","unit":"percentage","title":"Proportion of population access to improved sanitation facilities"},{"series":"population","unit":"total count","title":"Population access to improved sanitation facilities"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO2-02-02"}
