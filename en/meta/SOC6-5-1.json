This indicator reflects the extent to which fiscal authority and resources are being decentralized from the national level to local governments.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the process of fiscal decentralization, where financial resources and authority are increasingly transferred from the central government to lower levels of government, such as provinces and municipalities. Devolution of funding authority allows local governments to have greater control over their budgets, enabling them to tailor operations and programs to meet the specific needs of their communities. This can enhance the efficiency, responsiveness, and accountability of public service delivery at the local level.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the change in annual budget allocations to provinces and municipalities is crucial for assessing the progress of fiscal decentralization efforts. An increase in budget allocations to local governments suggests that there is greater devolution of financial authority, which can empower local governments to better address local priorities and improve service delivery. Conversely, a decrease or stagnation in budget allocations may indicate challenges in the decentralization process or central government reluctance to relinquish fiscal control.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Change in Annual Budget Going to Provinces, Municipalities Towards Operations/Programs (Devolution of Funding Authority),\" first collect data on the total budget allocated by the central government to provinces and municipalities in both the current and previous years. Then, subtract the previous year's budget allocation from the current year's allocation to determine the change. If needed, divide this change by the previous year's budget allocation and multiply by 100 to express the change as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nChange in Budget Allocation=Budget Allocation in Current Year \u2013 Budget Allocation in Previous Year\nPercentage Change in Budget Allocation (%) = (Change in Budget Allocation/Budget Allocation in Previous Year) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"12.7.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Change in annual budget going to Provinces, Municipalities towards operations/programs (Devolution of funding authority)","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC6-05-01"}
