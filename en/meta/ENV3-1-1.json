This indicator reflects the level of integration of CC and DRM considerations across different sectors of government.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which government ministries are equipped with the necessary frameworks\u2014policies, budgets, and legislation\u2014to address climate change and disaster risk management. It assesses whether these ministries have developed specific strategies, allocated financial resources, and passed relevant laws to effectively manage climate risks and reduce vulnerabilities to disasters. The indicator provides insights into the government's commitment to mainstreaming climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction across all sectors.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of government ministries with CC and DRM policies, budgets, and legislation is essential for evaluating the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of a government's response to climate change and disaster risks. An integrated approach, where all relevant ministries are actively engaged in CC and DRM efforts, is critical for building resilience, protecting communities, and ensuring sustainable development.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Government Ministries with Policies, Budgets, and Legislation for Climate Change (CC) & Disaster Risk Management (DRM),\" first identify the total number of relevant government ministries. Then, collect data on whether each ministry has established policies, allocated budgets, and enacted legislation specifically for CC and DRM. Next, count the number of ministries that have all three elements in place. Finally, divide this number by the total number of relevant ministries and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Ministries with CC & DRM Frameworks (%) = (Number of Ministries with Policies, Budgets, and Legislation for CC & DRM / Total Number of Ministries) \u00d7 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic Policy Planning & Aid Coordination","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of government ministries with policies, budgets, and legislation for CC & DRM","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-01-01"}
