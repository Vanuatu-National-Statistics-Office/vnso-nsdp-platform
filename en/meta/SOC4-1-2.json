Participation can include involvement in discussions, voting, or influencing outcomes in decision-making processes.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the level of involvement of women in decision-making processes across various sectors, including government, business, civil society, and other organizations. The participation of women in decision-making is crucial for ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered and that decisions are more representative of the entire population. This indicator reflects the extent to which gender inclusivity is being practiced in leadership and governance.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of decisions in which women participate is essential for assessing progress toward gender equality in leadership and decision-making roles. Women's participation in decision-making processes contributes to more equitable and inclusive outcomes, which are vital for addressing the needs and interests of all members of society.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Decisions in Which Women Participate,\" first identify and list all relevant decision-making bodies within the specified organization or sector. Then, collect data on the number of decisions made during a specified period and record instances where women were actively involved in the decision-making process. Finally, sum the total number of decisions in which women participated across all identified decision-making bodies during the period.\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Decisions in Which Women Participate = Sum of All Decisions Where Women Actively Contributed \n","SDGAlignment":"5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.a.1 & 5.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Public Service Commission ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-05","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Age","unit":"% & total count","title":"Number of decision in which women in different age groups participate"},{"series":"Employment (preceding 12 months)","unit":"% & total count","title":"Number of decision in which women in employment participate"},{"series":"Number of living children","unit":"% & total count","title":"Number of decision in which women raising children participate"},{"series":"Residence","unit":"% & total count","title":"Number of decision in which women residing in rural or urban participate"},{"series":"Education","unit":"% & total count","title":"Number of decision in which women from different education level participate"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-01-02"}
