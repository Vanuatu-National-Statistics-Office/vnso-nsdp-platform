These skills are often passed down through generations and play a crucial role in maintaining traditional health practices and cultural heritage.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the retention and transmission of traditional health-related skills within a population. The ability to produce herbal medicines involves knowledge of local plants, their medicinal properties, and the methods of preparing them for therapeutic use. The ability to perform massage encompasses techniques that have been traditionally used for healing, relaxation, and maintaining physical well-being. Together, these skills are an integral part of traditional healthcare systems and reflect the cultural practices related to health and wellness.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that can produce herbal medicines and perform massage is essential for assessing the vitality of traditional health practices. As modern medicine becomes more widespread, these traditional skills may be at risk of being lost.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Ability to 1: Produce Herbal Medicines, and 2: Massage,\" first collect data through surveys or census to assess individuals' proficiency in these traditional health skills. Identify the number of respondents who possess the knowledge and skills to produce herbal medicines and/or perform traditional massage. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of skilled individuals by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population with Traditional Health Skills (%) = (Number of Individuals with Herbal Medicine and Massage Skills/Total Population Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"11.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 Years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-14","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-25","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"%","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with ability to 1: produce herbal medicines, and 2: massage","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-02-03"}
