This includes the sum of the value of exports, imports, and other economic activities directly attributable to the MSG Trade Agreement, relative to the overall size of the economy","Concept":"This indicator tracks the economic significance of the MSG Trade Agreement by assessing its contribution to the national economy in relation to GDP. The estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement typically includes the value of goods and services traded between member countries, investment flows, and other direct economic benefits resulting from the agreement. By expressing this value as a proportion of GDP, the indicator provides insight into how much the MSG Trade Agreement contributes to the country's economic output.","Disaggregation":"None","Rationale":"Rationale and interpretation:\nMonitoring the total estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement as a proportion of GDP is crucial for understanding the impact of this regional trade agreement on the domestic economy. A higher proportion indicates that the MSG Trade Agreement plays a significant role in the economy, contributing to economic growth, regional integration, and increased trade and investment flows. Conversely, a lower proportion might suggest that the agreement has a limited impact or that there are untapped opportunities within the MSG framework.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Estimated Value of MSG Trade Agreement as Proportion of GDP,\" first collect data on the total estimated economic value generated from the MSG Trade Agreement, including the value of exports. Then, obtain the total GDP for the same reporting period. Calculate the proportion by dividing the total estimated value of the MSG Trade Agreement by the GDP and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of MSG Trade Agreement Value of GDP= ((Total Value of Exports (MSG))/GDP)*100\n","SDGAlignment":"10.a.1\n17.10.1\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Customs & Inland Revenue Department, Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-09","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total estimated value of trade agreement as proportion of GDP","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"In 2021, the estimated total trade value under trade agreements accounted for 3.4% of Vanuatu\u2019s GDP, down slightly from 3.7% in 2020. Export contributions remained steady at 0.8% in both years, while imports declined from 2.9% to 2.7% of GDP. This suggests a minor contraction in trade flows covered by agreements, potentially reflecting broader trade or economic disruptions.\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-06-02"}
