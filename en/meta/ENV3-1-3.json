This alignment reflects how well sectoral actions support and are integrated into broader climate and disaster resilience objectives.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the degree of coherence and coordination between the programs of sector stakeholders and the overarching policies and legislation on climate change and disaster risk management. Alignment ensures that sector-specific initiatives contribute to national goals, avoid conflicts or redundancies, and effectively address the challenges posed by climate change and disasters. The indicator helps to assess whether sector stakeholders are working in a coordinated manner to achieve common objectives in climate resilience and disaster preparedness.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the alignment of sector stakeholders\u2019 programs with CC & DRM policies and legislation is critical for ensuring a unified and effective approach to managing climate and disaster risks. When programs are aligned with national policies, it enhances the effectiveness of interventions, maximizes resource use, and ensures that all sectors contribute to building resilience.","MethodOfComputation":"To assess the \"Alignment of Sector Stakeholders\u2019 Programs with Climate Change (CC) & Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Policies and Legislation,\" first identify the relevant programs of key sector stakeholders. Then, review the national CC & DRM policies and legislation to determine the key objectives and requirements. Next, assess the degree of alignment between each stakeholder\u2019s programs and these national policies. Optionally, create a scoring system to quantify the level of alignment, or calculate the proportion of programs that are fully aligned by dividing the number of aligned programs by the total number of programs reviewed and expressing the result as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Aligned Programs (%) = (Number of Fully or Partially Aligned Programs/Total Number of Assessed Programs) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic Policy Planning and Aid Coordination","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":true,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Alignment of sector stakeholders\u2019 programs and CC & DRM policies and legislation","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (CCDRR) Policy Implementation Plan provides a clear framework for aligning sectoral programs with national climate change (CC) and disaster risk management (DRM) priorities.
