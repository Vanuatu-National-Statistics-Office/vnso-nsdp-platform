Trained observers are individuals who monitor and report on compliance with fishing regulations, environmental standards, and safety protocols while at sea.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the presence of trained observers on licensed vessels, which is a critical component of effective fisheries management and maritime regulation. Observers play a key role in ensuring that vessels comply with legal requirements, such as catch limits, bycatch regulations, and environmental protection measures. Their presence helps to prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and ensures that maritime operations adhere to safety and environmental standards.","Disaggregation":"Vessel type","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of licensed vessels with trained observers on board is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement efforts in the maritime sector. A higher percentage indicates strong oversight and compliance with regulations, contributing to sustainable fisheries management and environmental protection. Conversely, a lower percentage may suggest gaps in monitoring, which could lead to non-compliance with regulations and increased risks of illegal activities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Licensed Vessels Which Have Trained Observers On Board,\" first collect data on the total number of licensed fishing or commercial vessels operating within the specified period. Then, gather data on how many of these vessels had trained observers on board during their operations. Next, divide the number of vessels with observers by the total number of licensed vessels and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Vessels with Observers (%) = (Number of Licensed Vessels with Observers/Total Number of Licensed Vessels) * 100\n\n","SDGAlignment":"14.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Fisheries ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of licensed vessels which have trained observers on board","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC5-04-02"}
