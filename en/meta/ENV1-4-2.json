These training programs are organized or supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, & Biosecurity (MALFFB), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or other partnered initiatives.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the participation in training programs that aim to enhance knowledge and skills in food storage and preservation techniques. Effective food storage and preservation are critical for reducing food waste, extending the shelf life of food products, and ensuring food security, especially in regions where food production is seasonal or where access to fresh food may be limited. The training provided through MALFFB, NGOs, and other partners is designed to empower individuals, particularly those in rural and agricultural communities, with the skills necessary to safely store and preserve food, thereby improving household food security and resilience.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of people receiving training in food storage and preservation is essential for assessing the outreach and effectiveness of capacity-building initiatives aimed at improving food security. Training in these areas is crucial for reducing post-harvest losses, ensuring the availability of nutritious food throughout the year, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of People Receiving Training in Food Storage and Preservation Per Year,\" first collect data on the number of participants in each training program organized or supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, & Biosecurity (MALFFB), NGOs, and partnered initiatives. Verify that the training programs focus on food storage and preservation techniques. Then, sum the total number of individuals who completed the training across all programs within the year.\n\n\nFormula\nTotal Number of People Trained= Total Number of Participants in Each Training \n","SDGAlignment":"12.8.1, 12.a.1 & 14.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number of individuals trained per year","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, & Biosecurity","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Total number of people receiving training in food storage and preservation per year in MALFFB led, NGO or partnered initiatives","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-04-02"}
