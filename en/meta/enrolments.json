{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cNumber of Children Attending School by Province, Island, and Class\u201d measures the total number of children who are physically attending school during a given academic year, disaggregated by province, island, and class level.","Concept":"School attendance refers to the presence of children in formal learning environments on a regular basis, as distinct from enrolment figures which may include those registered but not attending. \"Class\" indicates the grade or level of schooling (e.g. Class 1, Class 2), while \"island\" and \"province\" identify the geographic location of the school. Together, these dimensions enable detailed spatial and educational analysis of participation in the school system.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring actual school attendance is critical for understanding access to education and identifying barriers to sustained participation. Disaggregation by class, island, and province allows for targeted policy responses to address regional disparities, dropout risks, and education resource gaps. It also supports planning efforts for teacher deployment, infrastructure investment, and inclusive education strategies.","MethodOfComputation":"This indicator is calculated using administrative records collected from schools or education offices. Data is aggregated to count the number of attending students per class level, island, and province within a given school year.\n\nFormula: \nNone required, the indicator is a direct count of children attending school.\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education & Training  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu School Enrollments Rates ","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu School Enrollments Rate","indicator_number":"school enrolment rates","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Education- Enrolment \nSchool attendance steadily increased from 87,500 in 2018 to nearly 99,000 in 2021, with stable figures maintained into 2022. This suggests a sustained effort in ensuring access to education, even during periods of broader social and economic disruption. Attendance data disaggregated by class and geography helps identify dropout risks and regional disparities, particularly in remote islands. These trends support planning for teacher allocation, infrastructure needs, and targeted interventions in underserved areas.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"enrolments","goal_number":"enrolments","indicator_sort_order":"enrolments"}
