{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cEnrolment in Vocational Training Programmes\u201d measures the total number of individuals enrolled in accredited vocational training programmes during a given year. It includes enrolments across different qualification levels (e.g., Certificate, Diploma, Bachelor) and is disaggregated by island and field of study or course.","Concept":"Vocational training refers to education that prepares individuals for specific trades, crafts, and careers at various levels. It includes both technical and non-technical fields and is commonly delivered by Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions. \"Enrolment\" refers to the official registration of students in these programmes during the reference year. Disaggregation by course and island provides insights into geographic and sectoral demand for skills development across Vanuatu.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"This indicator helps assess the accessibility and uptake of vocational education, which is a key driver for employment, economic development, and lifelong learning. It also informs policies related to workforce development, education planning, and decentralization of training services. High or growing enrolment figures in specific fields can indicate emerging labour market needs or successful training outreach efforts.","MethodOfComputation":"The indicator is calculated by aggregating administrative data from TVET institutions and education authorities. Enrolment numbers are summed for each course and island for the specified year. The data includes both new and continuing students.\n\nFormula: \nNone required, the indicator is a direct count of children attending school.\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education & Training  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Vocational Education","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu Vocational Education","indicator_number":"vocational education","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Vocational\nEnrolment in vocational training programmes grew significantly from just 22 students in 2016 to over 2,000 by 2021, reflecting expanding access and increased demand for skills-based education. While enrolment dipped slightly to 1,624 in 2022, overall uptake remains substantially higher than pre-2019 levels. Programmes in agriculture, aquaculture, construction, and tourism are among the most common, indicating alignment with national development priorities. These trends suggest strengthened outreach and relevance of vocational training, though continued monitoring is needed to ensure equitable access across islands.\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"vocational","goal_number":"vocational","indicator_sort_order":"vocational"}
