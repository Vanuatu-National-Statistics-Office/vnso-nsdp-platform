Geo-scientific information includes data related to geology, geomorphology, soil composition, mineral resources, seismic activity, and other earth science-related aspects.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts made to collect detailed geo-scientific information across various locations within a specified region or country. Geo-scientific data is crucial for understanding the physical characteristics of the Earth's surface and subsurface, which is essential for various applications, including natural resource management, environmental protection, land use planning, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure development. The indicator reflects the extent of data collection activities aimed at building a robust knowledge base of the geological characteristics of different areas.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of places where detailed geo-scientific information has been collected is important for evaluating the progress in building a comprehensive understanding of the geological landscape. Such information is vital for informed decision-making in resource management, hazard assessment, and sustainable development.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Places Where Detailed Geo-Scientific Information Has Been Collected,\" first identify all the locations where geo-scientific data has been gathered, such as sites of geological surveys, soil sampling, or seismic monitoring. Verify that comprehensive data has been collected at each site by reviewing research reports and records. Then, count the total number of sites where such data has been collected within the reporting period.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Places with Geo-Scientific Data Collected = Sum of All Verified Data Collection Sites \n","SDGAlignment":"14.5.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of places where detailed geo-scientific information has been collected","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-05-03"}
