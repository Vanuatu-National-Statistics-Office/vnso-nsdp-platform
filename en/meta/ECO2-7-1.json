These audits aim to identify areas of non-compliance and ensure that transportation systems meet required safety, environmental, and operational standards.","Concept":"The \"Total Number of External Audits Undertaken to Establish Compliance with Conventions and Standards and Expose Non-Conformity\" indicator measures the total number of external audits conducted on transportation systems (including road, sea, and air transport) to assess their compliance with international and national conventions, standards, and regulations. These audits aim to identify areas of non-compliance and ensure that transportation systems meet required safety, environmental, and operational standards.","Disaggregation":"Type of Transport, Region & Time Period","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of external transport audits is essential for maintaining and improving the safety, reliability, and compliance of transportation systems. Regular audits help to identify and address non-compliance with conventions and standards, which could otherwise lead to safety hazards, environmental damage, legal penalties, and a loss of public trust. By tracking the number of these audits, transportation authorities, policymakers, and regulatory bodies can assess the effectiveness of compliance efforts, identify systemic issues, and implement corrective actions.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of External Audits Undertaken to Establish Compliance with Conventions and Standards and Expose Non-Conformity,\" first collect data from regulatory bodies and external auditors on the number of audits conducted on road, sea, and air transport systems within a specific period. Categorize the audits based on the mode of transport and the standards assessed, then sum the total number of audits to determine the overall level of external auditing activity.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of External Transport Audits= Sum of Audits Conducted on Road, Sea, and Air Transport Systems\n","SDGAlignment":"11.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-10","national_data_updated_date":"2025-07-10","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"reporting_status":"notstarted","data_non_statistical":true,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"ECO2-07-01","graph_title":"global_indicators.ECO2-7-1-title"}
