Addressing a case involves taking appropriate actions, such as investigation, legal proceedings, provision of support services, or resolution, within a specified period.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the responsiveness of law enforcement, social services, and other relevant agencies in handling cases of violence against women, children, and vulnerable populations. Addressing a case means not only initiating an investigation but also providing necessary support services (e.g., counselling, legal aid, medical care) and ensuring that justice and protection are delivered to the victims. The indicator reflects the efficiency and effectiveness of the system in responding to reports of violence and in protecting vulnerable individuals.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the percentage of reported cases of violence that are addressed is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the justice system, social services, and protection mechanisms in safeguarding vulnerable populations. A high percentage indicates that reported cases are being actively managed and resolved, which is essential for maintaining public trust in the system and for ensuring the safety and well-being of victims. Conversely, a low percentage may indicate systemic challenges such as under-resourcing, lack of capacity, or barriers to accessing justice and support.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Percentage of Reported Cases of Violence Against Women, Children, and Vulnerable People Addressed,\" first collect data on the total number of reported cases within a specified period. Then, gather data on how many of these cases have been addressed through actions such as investigation, legal proceedings, or support services. Next, divide the number of addressed cases by the total number of reported cases, and multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nPercentage of Reported Cases Addressed (%) = (Number of Cases Addressed/Total Number of Reported Cases) * 100","SDGAlignment":"5.1.1, 5.2.1 & 5.2.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Police Force","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of reported cases of violence against women, children, and vulnerable people addressed","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-02-03"}
