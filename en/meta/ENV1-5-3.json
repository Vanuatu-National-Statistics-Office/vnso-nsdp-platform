Integrated farming practices refer to the combination of various agricultural activities\u2014such as crop cultivation, livestock rearing, aquaculture, and agroforestry\u2014on the same farm to optimize resource use, enhance productivity, and promote sustainability.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the adoption of integrated farming systems, which are designed to create synergies between different agricultural activities. Integrated farming practices aim to improve farm efficiency by utilizing the waste or by-products of one activity as inputs for another (e.g., using livestock manure as fertilizer for crops). These practices contribute to sustainable agriculture by reducing reliance on external inputs, improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and increasing resilience to environmental stresses.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of farmers involved in integrated farming practices is crucial for understanding the extent of sustainable agricultural practices within a region or country. Integrated farming can lead to more efficient use of resources, reduced environmental impact, and increased farm profitability. This indicator helps assess the effectiveness of policies and programs aimed at encouraging integrated farming and provides insights into the overall sustainability of the agricultural sector.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Farmers Involved in Integrated Farming Practices,\" first collect data on the total number of farmers in the region or country, and then gather data on the number of farmers who are actively practicing integrated farming. Next, divide the number of farmers involved in integrated farming by the total number of farmers. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Farmers Involved in Integrated Farming Practices (%) = (Number of Farmers Practicing Integrated Farming/Total Number of Farmers) * 100\n\n","SDGAlignment":"2.3.1, 2.3.2 & 12.8.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of farmers involved in integrated farming practices","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-05-03"}
