This review process typically involves analyzing the legal text, its application, and its impact to ensure that it promotes equality and does not perpetuate discrimination based on gender or other protected characteristics.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts made by a country or legal body to assess and reform its legal framework to eliminate discriminatory and gender-biased provisions. Discriminatory laws are those that create or perpetuate inequalities between different groups, often to the disadvantage of women or marginalized populations. Gender bias in laws can manifest in unequal treatment or outcomes for different genders, particularly in areas such as family law, labour law, and criminal law.","Disaggregation":"Type of law (civil, criminal, labour, family law)","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of laws reviewed for discrimination and gender bias is crucial for promoting a legal system that upholds the principles of equality and justice. The review and revision of discriminatory laws are key steps in ensuring that legal frameworks protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of gender.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Laws Reviewed on the Basis of Discriminatory and Gender Biased Principles,\" first identify and list all relevant laws that may require review for discriminatory and gender-biased content. Then, conduct a formal review of these laws. Next, collect data on the number of laws that have been reviewed and divide this by the total number of relevant laws. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion of reviewed laws as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Laws Reviewed (%) = (Number of Laws Reviewed for Discrimination and Gender Bias/Total Number of Relevant Laws) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"16.a.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Parliament of Vanuatu","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of laws reviewed on basis of discriminatory and gender biased principles","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-04-03"}
