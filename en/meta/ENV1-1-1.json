This includes activities such as home gardening, subsistence farming, livestock rearing, and other forms of food production intended to meet the household's dietary needs.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which households rely on self-produced food as a part of their food security strategy. In many regions, particularly in rural areas, households engage in food production to reduce their dependence on market-purchased food, enhance food security, and maintain traditional agricultural practices. The indicator provides insight into the prevalence of subsistence farming and the role of household food production in ensuring access to nutritious food.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of households engaged in food production for own consumption is essential for understanding food security, rural livelihoods, and agricultural practices within a population. A higher proportion of households engaged in such activities may indicate a reliance on subsistence farming, which can be critical for food security, particularly in areas with limited access to markets or during times of economic hardship. Conversely, a lower proportion might suggest a shift towards market dependency for food or increased urbanization.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Households Engaged in Production of Food for Own Consumption,\" first collect data on the number of households involved in food production primarily for their own dietary needs. Then, obtain the total number of households in the population or region being studied. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of households engaged in food production by the total number of households, and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Households Engaged in Food Production (%) = (Number Households Engaged in Food Production for Own Consumption/Total Number of Households) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"2.3.1,  2.3.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of households engaged in production of food for own consumption","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-01-01"}
