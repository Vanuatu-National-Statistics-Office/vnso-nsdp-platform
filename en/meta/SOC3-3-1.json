This vaccine protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) and is a critical component of childhood immunization programs.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the coverage of the DTP3 vaccine, which is essential for preventing the spread of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis\u2014three highly contagious and potentially deadly diseases. The DTP3 immunization is typically administered as part of a routine childhood vaccination schedule. High coverage rates indicate effective immunization programs, contributing to herd immunity and the reduction of disease outbreaks.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring DTP3 immunization coverage among 1-year-olds is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of national immunization programs. High coverage rates are associated with lower incidences of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, leading to improved public health outcomes. Conversely, low coverage rates may signal gaps in healthcare access, vaccine availability, or public health education.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoid, and Pertussis (DTP3) Immunization Coverage Among 1-Year-Olds (%),\" first collect data on the number of children who received the third dose of the DTP vaccine by their first birthday. Then, obtain the total number of children who turned one year old during the reporting period. Calculate the coverage rate by dividing the number of children who received DTP3 by the total number of 1-year-olds, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nDTP3 Immunization Coverage (%) = (Number of 1 Year Olds Receiving DTP3/Total Number of 1 Year Olds) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"3.b.1 & 3.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-04","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage of population (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunisation coverage among 1 year olds (%)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year of latest available data","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-03-01"}
