Indigenous languages are those that are native to a specific region or community and are traditionally spoken by indigenous peoples.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the vitality and daily usage of indigenous languages within a population. Indigenous languages are crucial carriers of cultural identity, traditional knowledge, and community values. The regular use of these languages in daily life indicates their continued relevance and the strength of cultural heritage within the community. The indicator provides insight into the linguistic diversity of a population and the degree to which indigenous languages are maintained and transmitted across generations.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population that speaks an indigenous language daily is essential for assessing the health and preservation of these languages. Indigenous languages are often at risk of decline or extinction due to factors such as globalization, urbanization, and the dominance of majority languages.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population Speaking Indigenous Language Daily,\" first collect data on language use through surveys or census, asking respondents about their primary language of communication and the frequency of indigenous language use. Identify the number of individuals who report speaking an indigenous language daily. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of daily speakers by the total population surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Daily Indigenous Language Speakers (% )= (Number of Daily Indigenous Language Speakers/Total Population Surveyed) * 100\n\n","SDGAlignment":"\n11.4.1 (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5 - 10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics \n","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","bi":{"TargetDescription":"","SDGAlignment":"","Definition":"Percentage of the population who report speaking their indigenous language every day (translated)","Concept":"","Rationale":"","ComputationMethod":"","ComputationUnit":"","Proxy":"","Disaggregation":"","DataSource":"","FrequencyOfCollection":"","source_organisation_1":"2012 Pacific Living Conditions Survey (Hybrid) - VNSO and SPC","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":""},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-06-23","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-24","progress":[{"target":"20% increase in exports","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"SOC1-01-01","graph_title":"global_indicators.SOC1-1-1-title"}
