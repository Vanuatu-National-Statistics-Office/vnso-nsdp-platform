This indicator also tracks whether these systems have comprehensive maintenance plans to ensure their continuous functionality and reliability.","Concept":"This indicator focuses on the establishment of integrated warning systems that can detect, monitor, and provide alerts for multiple hazards. A multi-hazard warning system is designed to serve as an early warning mechanism, helping to mitigate the impacts of disasters by providing critical information to communities, governments, and response agencies. The inclusion of maintenance plans ensures that these systems remain operational, are regularly tested, and are capable of providing accurate warnings when needed.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the establishment of multi-hazard warning systems with maintenance plans is crucial for enhancing disaster preparedness and resilience. Effective warning systems save lives, reduce economic losses, and minimize the damage caused by disasters. Having a maintenance plan in place is equally important, as it ensures that the systems are regularly checked, updated, and functioning optimally when disasters strike.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Establishment of Multi-Hazard Warning Systems with Maintenance Plans in Place,\" first identify all the multi-hazard warning systems that have been established within the region or country. Verify that these systems are fully operational and capable of issuing timely alerts for various hazards. Then, assess whether formal maintenance plans are in place for each system. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of warning systems with maintenance plans by the total number of established systems, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Established Systems with Maintenance Plans (%) = (Number of Multi-Hazard Warning Systems with Maintenance Plans/Total Number of Established Multi-Hazard Warning Systems) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.1.1 , 13.1.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Climate Change and Adaptation","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":true,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Establishment of multi-hazard warning systems with maintenance plans in place","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"The VAN-KIRAP Project has played a key role in supporting the establishment of multi-hazard early warning systems across Vanuatu. Through this initiative, essential infrastructure and protocols have been developed to monitor and disseminate warnings related to a range of hazards, including cyclones, floods, droughts, and volcanic activity. The project has also supported the development of standard operating procedures, community outreach, and institutional capacity-building to ensure warnings reach local populations in a timely and accessible manner. In addition, maintenance plans and sustainability measures are being integrated to ensure the long-term functionality and reliability of these systems beyond the life of the project.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-02-01"}
