Disabilities can be physical, sensory, cognitive, or psychosocial and can range from mild to severe. The indicator typically encompasses both temporary and permanent disabilities.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the prevalence of disability within a population, providing insight into the proportion of individuals who experience limitations in functioning due to physical, mental, sensory, or emotional conditions. Disabilities can affect various aspects of life, including mobility, communication, self-care, and participation in work or social activities. Understanding the proportion of the population with disabilities helps in identifying the scale of need for accessible services, support, and policies aimed at inclusion.","Disaggregation":"Region, Sex","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population reporting some degree of disability is crucial for developing and implementing policies and programs that promote accessibility, inclusion, and equality. It also supports the assessment of compliance with international commitments, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and national policies aimed at improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population Reporting Some Degree of Disability,\" first design and administer a survey that includes questions about various types of disabilities. Then, identify the individuals who report having some degree of disability based on their responses. Next, divide the number of individuals reporting disabilities by the total number of respondents in the survey. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population Reporting Disability (%) = (Number of Individuals Reporting Disability/Total Population) * 100","SDGAlignment":"10.3.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Blindness","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of blindness"},{"series":"Deafness","unit":"Percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of deafness"},{"series":"Lameness","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of blindness"},{"series":"Senile and/or Amnesic","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of senile and/or amnesic"},{"series":"Self-Care","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of self-care"},{"series":"Communicating","unit":"percentage (%)","title":"Proportion of population reporting some degree of self-care"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-03-01"}
