These guidelines provide frameworks, best practices, and standards for managing environmental issues, ensuring sustainable development, and mitigating the impact of various activities on the environment.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the development of environmental guidelines, which are essential tools for guiding policymakers, businesses, and communities in environmental management. These guidelines typically cover a range of environmental topics such as waste management, pollution control, biodiversity conservation, sustainable resource use, and climate change adaptation. The indicator reflects efforts to strengthen environmental governance and promote sustainability by providing clear, actionable guidance for various stakeholders.","Disaggregation":"Sector","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of environmental guidelines developed is crucial for assessing the progress of environmental policy and governance. Well-developed guidelines are vital for standardizing environmental practices, reducing environmental harm, and ensuring compliance with national and international environmental regulations. They help in translating broad environmental policies into specific actions that can be implemented by industries, governments, and communities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Environmental Guidelines Developed,\" first gather data on all environmental guidelines created within the specified period from government agencies, environmental organizations, or relevant regulatory bodies. Then, verify that these guidelines are officially recognized, formally documented, and aimed at addressing specific environmental issues or promoting sustainable practices. Finally, count the total number of guidelines that meet these criteria within the specified time frame.\n\nFormula:\nNumber of Environmental Guidelines Developed= Total Developed and Approved Environmental Guidelines\n","SDGAlignment":"11.c.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"No. of environmental guidelines developed","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-02-02"}
