These plans are designed to address the complex and interconnected issues affecting coastal zones, including environmental conservation, sustainable resource use, disaster risk reduction, and socio-economic development.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts made to establish and execute Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) plans, which are strategic frameworks that guide the sustainable development and management of coastal areas. ICM plans are holistic and multidisciplinary, incorporating environmental, social, and economic considerations to ensure the long-term health and resilience of coastal ecosystems and communities. The indicator reflects the progress in adopting a coordinated approach to managing coastal resources and mitigating the impacts of human activities and natural hazards.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of integrated coastal management plans developed and implemented is essential for assessing the effectiveness of coastal governance and the commitment to sustainable coastal development. Coastal areas are often under significant pressure from activities such as tourism, fishing, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as from the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. ICM plans help to balance these competing interests, protect coastal ecosystems, and enhance the resilience of coastal communities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Integrated Coastal Management Plans Developed and Implemented,\" first identify all Integrated Coastal Management plans that have been developed for coastal areas. Verify that these plans are not only created but are also actively being implemented by reviewing reports and monitoring outcomes. Then, count the total number of ICM plans that have been both developed and put into action within the reporting period.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of ICM Plans Developed and Implemented = Sum of All Verified ICM Plans Developed and Implemented \n","SDGAlignment":"14.4.1 & 15.1.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Fisheries, Department of Environmental Conservation & Protection ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of integrated coastal management plans developed and implemented","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-04-02"}
