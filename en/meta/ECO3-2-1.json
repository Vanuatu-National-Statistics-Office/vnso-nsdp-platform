This income may come from various sources, such as providing accommodation, food services, transportation, guiding services, or selling goods and services to tourists.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the economic benefits that households derive from the tourism industry. Tourism can be a significant source of income, particularly in regions that attract a large number of visitors. The indicator provides insight into how tourism contributes to household income, which is important for understanding the broader economic impact of the tourism sector on local communities. The income measured includes direct earnings from tourism-related jobs, self-employment in tourism, and income from tourism-dependent businesses operated by households.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the average annual household income from tourism is crucial for assessing the economic impact of the tourism sector on local communities and households. A higher average income from tourism indicates that the sector is providing substantial economic benefits to the population, contributing to poverty alleviation, economic growth, and improved living standards.","MethodOfComputation":"To calculate the average annual household income from tourism, data is collected on the income earned by individual households engaged in tourism-related activities. This data is then aggregated to determine the total income from tourism for all households in the area. This total is divided by the number of households to derive the average income figure.","SDGAlignment":"8.9.1\n8.9.2\n17.17.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"vatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every Five Years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-31","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Average annual household income tourism (vatu)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Average annual household income from tourism","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-02-01"}
