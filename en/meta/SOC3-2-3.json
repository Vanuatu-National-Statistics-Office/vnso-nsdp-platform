This rate is calculated based on the total number of laboratory-confirmed malaria cases divided by the population at risk, providing a standardized measure of the prevalence of malaria within a given area.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the incidence of malaria, which is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The annual parasite incidence rate is an essential measure for understanding the burden of malaria within a population and assessing the effectiveness of malaria control and prevention programs. The focus on laboratory-confirmed cases ensures that the data reflects actual incidences of malaria, excluding unconfirmed or suspected cases.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the malaria annual parasite incidence rate is crucial for evaluating the success of public health interventions aimed at reducing malaria transmission. High incidence rates indicate ongoing transmission and may highlight areas where additional resources or strategies are needed. Conversely, low or declining rates suggest progress toward malaria control and elimination goals.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Malaria Annual Parasite Incidence Rate,\" first collect data on the number of confirmed malaria cases reported within the specified year. Then, obtain the total population data for the area where these cases were reported. Calculate the incidence rate by dividing the number of confirmed malaria cases by the total population and multiplying the result by 1,000 to express the rate as the number of malaria cases per 1,000 population.\n\n\nFormula:\nMalaria Annual Parasite Incidence Rate (per 1,000 population) = (Number of Confirmed Malaria Cases/Total Population) * 1,000\n","SDGAlignment":"3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5 & 3.4.1 ","UnitOfMeasurement":"Incidence per 1,000 population","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Malaria annual parasite incidence rate","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-02-03"}
