These plans cover various aspects of disaster management, including coordination, planning, preparedness, response, and recovery.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the availability and dissemination of disaster management support plans at the community level. Support plans are comprehensive documents that outline the roles, responsibilities, strategies, and resources needed to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. These plans are crucial for ensuring that communities are equipped with the knowledge and tools to manage risks and reduce the impact of disasters. The indicator reflects the efforts made by governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to enhance community resilience and disaster readiness.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of support plans available to communities is essential for assessing the level of preparedness and resilience at the local level. Well-developed support plans provide clear guidance for community leaders, emergency responders, and residents, helping them to coordinate efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement timely responses during disasters.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Support Plans Available to Communities for Coordination, Planning, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery,\" first identify and list all the relevant support plans developed and made available to communities. Then, verify that these plans are accessible to the communities they are intended to serve. Finally, count the total number of these available and accessible support plans.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Support Plans Available= Total of All Verified Support Plans Available to Communities \n","SDGAlignment":"13.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Climate Change and Adaptation","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of support plans available to communities for coordination, planning, preparedness, response and recovery","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-03-01"}
