{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The indicator \u201cExports by Commodity and Country\u201d measures the total value, quantity, and unit price of goods exported from the country, disaggregated by commodity type and destination country. It reflects the composition and destination of national export flows.","Concept":"The indicator is based on the concept of export-led growth and trade performance monitoring. Exports are a critical driver of economic development, foreign exchange earnings, and sectoral competitiveness. Disaggregating exports by commodity allows for sector-specific insights (e.g. agriculture, manufacturing), while analysis by country reveals trading relationships, market access, and export concentration risk. The inclusion of unit prices enables assessment of product competitiveness and value-addition trends.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring exports is essential to understand how the national economy engages in international markets. Increases in export value may reflect improved global demand, increased production, or enhanced trade terms. Tracking exports by product supports sectoral planning (e.g. boosting cocoa or kava exports), while tracking by country highlights dependency on specific markets or emerging trade opportunities. Unit prices provide further context, helping identify price competitiveness and market positioning of key commodities.","MethodOfComputation":"Export Value: Sum the reported value of each exported commodity by year and destination country, based on customs declarations.\nExport Quantity: Sum the total physical quantity (in kg/tonnes/litres) of each commodity exported.\nUnit Price: Divide export value by quantity to calculate the price per unit.\n\nFormula: \nTotal Export Value (VUV) = \u2211 Export value by commodity and country\nTotal Export Quantity (kg/tonnes/litres) = \u2211 Export quantity by commodity\nUnit Price = Export Value \u00f7 Export Quantity\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Export Value: Million Vatu (VUV)\nQuantity: Kilograms or tonnes (as applicable)\nUnit Price: Vatu per kilogram/litre\n","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs and Inland Revenue ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Millions (vatu)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Value in million (Vatu)","unit":"VUV","title":"Export values of principle exports in million (Vatu"},{"series":"Quantity (in tonnes kilogram)","unit":"tonnes kilogram","title":"Quantity of principle exports in tonnes (kilogram)"},{"series":"Price per unit (vatu per kilogram/litre)","unit":"vatu per kilogram/litre","title":"price per unit in vatu per kilogram/litre"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu Trades Exports","indicator_number":"exports trades","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"### Trade- Exports\nVanuatu\u2019s total export value fluctuated between 3.3 and 6 billion Vatu from 2017 to 2024, with a notable dip in 2020 likely linked to pandemic-related disruptions. Export performance has gradually recovered, reaching 6 billion Vatu in 2024. Key commodities include copra, coconut oil, kava, and cocoa, which consistently form the backbone of export earnings. These trends reflect moderate export diversification and emphasize the continued importance of agricultural products and natural resources in Vanuatu\u2019s trade portfolio.","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"exports","goal_number":"exports","indicator_sort_order":"exports"}
