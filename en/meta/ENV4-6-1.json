Reforestation refers to the process of planting trees on land that was previously forested but has been cleared or degraded, while rehabilitation involves restoring degraded land to a more natural state, often through planting native vegetation or other restorative actions.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efforts to restore forest ecosystems and rehabilitate degraded lands within a given year. Reforestation and rehabilitation are critical components of sustainable land management, contributing to biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil stabilization, water regulation, and the overall enhancement of ecosystem services. The indicator provides insights into the scale and effectiveness of restoration activities, helping to assess progress toward environmental sustainability goals.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the annual estimated area of reforestation and rehabilitation is crucial for evaluating the success of environmental restoration programs and policies. Forests play a vital role in mitigating climate change, supporting biodiversity, and providing resources and livelihoods for communities.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Annual Estimated Area (Square km) of Reforestation and Rehabilitation,\" first identify all reforestation and rehabilitation projects carried out within the year. Estimate the total area covered by these projects by reviewing relevant reports, satellite imagery, and GIS data. Then, sum the estimated areas of all identified projects to obtain the total area reforested or rehabilitated within the year, expressed in square kilometres.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Area of Reforestation and Rehabilitation (sq km) = Sum of Area Covered by Each Reforestation/Rehabilitation Project (sq km) \n","SDGAlignment":"15.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Square kilometres ","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Annual estimated area (square km) of reforestation and rehabilitation","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-06-01"}
