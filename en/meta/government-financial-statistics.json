It reflects the government\u2019s planned spending priorities across sectors.","Concept":"This indicator reflects the concept of public resource allocation as a tool for implementing national priorities and ensuring fiscal transparency. It captures how governments plan to distribute funds across sectors, aligning with principles of efficiency, accountability, and equity. Budget allocations signal political intent and are essential for understanding how policies are resourced and operationalized.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring government budget allocation by ministry is essential for assessing how public resources are distributed across policy areas. It provides insight into government priorities and commitments, such as education, health, and infrastructure. It can be used for tracking policy alignment with development goals and for fiscal accountability and transparency. Interpreting shifts over time can reveal changes in focus or responses to macroeconomic conditions and sectoral needs.","MethodOfComputation":"Aggregate the budget values from the dataset for each ministry under the \"Original Budget\" series for the specified year. If needed, this can be disaggregated further by department or used to compute relative shares of the total budget.\n\nFormula: \nBudget Allocation for Ministry (M, year Y) = \u2211 Budget Value (Original Budget) for Ministry M in year Y\n","SDGAlignment":"","UnitOfMeasurement":"Millions of Vatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-24","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Government Financial Statistics","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Government Budget Allocation by Ministry","indicator_number":"government finance","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"## #Finance- Government Budget \nVanuatu\u2019s total original government budget grew from 8.5 billion Vatu in 2004 to a record 57.1 billion Vatu in 2024, showing a more than sixfold increase over two decades.
