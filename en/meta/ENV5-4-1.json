Biosecurity clearance involves the examination and approval of incoming vessels to ensure they do not introduce harmful pests, diseases, or invasive species that could threaten local ecosystems, agriculture, or public health.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of biosecurity measures applied to incoming air and sea traffic. Biosecurity clearance is a critical process that prevents the introduction and spread of non-native organisms that can have severe ecological, economic, and health impacts. The indicator reflects the ability of a country\u2019s biosecurity systems to monitor and manage risks associated with international travel and trade.","Disaggregation":"Transport Type","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of incoming planes and sea vessels that are cleared through biosecurity is essential for assessing the robustness of a country\u2019s defenses against biological threats. High clearance rates indicate strong biosecurity practices, reducing the risk of invasive species and pathogens entering the country.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Incoming Planes and Sea Vessels Cleared Through Biosecurity Annually,\" first identify the total number of airplanes and sea vessels arriving at the country\u2019s ports of entry within the year. Verify the number of these that have undergone biosecurity clearance. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of cleared vessels by the total number of incoming vessels, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Cleared Planes and Vessels (%) = (Number of Planes and Vessels Cleared Through Biosecurity/Total Number of Incoming Planes and Vessels) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"15.8.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Biosecurity","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of incoming planes and sea vessels cleared through Biosecurity annually","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV5-04-01"}
