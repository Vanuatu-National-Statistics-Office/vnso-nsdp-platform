The data is disaggregated by the type of abuse to provide detailed insights into the areas of violation.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the responsiveness of support systems to children who have experienced human rights violations, particularly in the areas of abuse and exploitation. Support services may include medical care, psychological counselling, legal aid, child protective services, shelter, and rehabilitation programs. By disaggregating data by type of abuse, the indicator provides a clearer understanding of the nature and extent of violations children face and the availability and utilization of services to support them.","Disaggregation":"Type of human rights violation ","Rationale":"Monitoring the total number of cases with children experiencing human rights violations who access support services is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of child protection systems. High numbers of children accessing support services can indicate awareness and availability of these services, while low numbers may suggest barriers to access, underreporting, or gaps in service provision. Disaggregating the data by type of abuse helps identify specific areas where additional resources or targeted interventions are needed.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Total Number of Cases with Children Experiencing Human Rights Violations in the Following Areas: Sexual Abuse, Neglect, Physical Abuse, Exploitation, Emotional Abuse Accessing Support Services,\" first identify and classify all reported cases where children have experienced these specific types of violations. Then, collect data on the number of these cases where children have accessed support services. Disaggregate the data by each type of violation to determine the number of cases in each category that have accessed services. Finally, sum the totals to provide the overall number of cases, disaggregated by the type of abuse.\n\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Cases Accessing Support Services = Sum of All (Cases of Sexual Abuse + Cases of Neglect + Cases of Physical Abuse + Cases of Exploitation + Cases of Emotional Abuse)\n","SDGAlignment":"16.2.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Police Force","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Total number of cases with children experiencing human rights violations in the following areas sexual abuse, neglect, physical abuse, exploitation, emotional abuse (disseminate by these areas) accessing support services","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-06-01"}
