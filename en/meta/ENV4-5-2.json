These operations involve the extraction of sand from various environments, such as riverbeds, beaches, and dunes, for use in construction, manufacturing, and other industries.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the presence and growth of commercial sand mining activities, which are a significant part of the construction and industrial sectors. Sand is a critical resource used in concrete production, glass manufacturing, and other construction-related activities. The indicator reflects the extent of sand extraction operations and provides insights into the economic activities related to natural resource utilization.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the number of commercial sand mines is essential for understanding the scale of sand extraction and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. While sand mining is crucial for economic development, it can lead to environmental degradation, including habitat destruction, riverbed erosion, and coastal erosion, if not managed sustainably.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Number of Commercial Sand Mines,\" first identify all active sand mines within the region or country by reviewing permits and licenses issued by regulatory agencies. Verify that these sand mines are commercially operated, meaning they extract sand for sale or industrial use. Then, count the total number of commercial sand mines that are operational within the reporting period.\n\nFormula:\nTotal Number of Commercial Sand Mines = Sum of All Verified Commercial Sand Mines\n","SDGAlignment":"14.5.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Number","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Geology & Mines ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Number of commercial sand mines","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV4-05-02"}
