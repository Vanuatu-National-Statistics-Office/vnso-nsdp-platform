This indicator focuses on key agricultural products such as coconut, kava, cocoa, and coffee, comparing the volume or value of these commodities that have undergone processing before export to those exported in their raw form.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the level of value addition in the export of key agricultural commodities. Processing raw agricultural products before export can significantly enhance their value, increase revenue, and create additional employment opportunities within the country. The ratio of processed to raw exports reflects the extent to which the economy is moving up the value chain in agricultural production, shifting from being a supplier of raw materials to a producer of higher-value goods.","Disaggregation":"Type of commodity","Rationale":"Monitoring the ratio of processed export commodities to raw exports is crucial for understanding the progress of industrialization and economic diversification within the agricultural sector. A higher ratio indicates a greater emphasis on value addition, which can lead to higher export revenues, better market positioning, and reduced vulnerability to fluctuations in raw commodity prices.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Ratio of Processed Export Commodities to Raw Exports,\" first gather data on the total value of processed export commodities, such as coconut oil, kava extracts, cocoa powder, and roasted coffee. Then, collect data on the total value of raw exports for the same commodities, such as raw coconut, unprocessed kava, raw cocoa beans, and green coffee beans. Finally, divide the total value of processed exports by the total value of raw exports, and express the result as a ratio.\n\nFormula:\nRatio of Processed to Raw Exports= Total Value of Processed Exports/Total Value of Raw Exports\n","SDGAlignment":"9.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Ratio","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Customs & Inland Revenue","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Ratio","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Ratio of processed export commodities (including coconut, kava, cocoa, coffee) to raw exports","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-03-02"}
