This review process involves assessing the quality, relevance, and completeness of the data to ensure it accurately reflects progress towards the goals and targets outlined in the NSDP.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the regularity and thoroughness with which the data related to the NSDP is reviewed by relevant authorities, such as government agencies, statistical offices, or independent evaluators. The purpose of this review is to ensure that the data used to monitor and report on the NSDP\u2019s implementation is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the plan\u2019s objectives. An annual review process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data, which in turn supports effective decision-making and policy adjustments.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"Monitoring the annual review of NSDP data is essential for ensuring that progress toward sustainable development goals is accurately measured and reported. Regular data reviews help identify gaps, inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in the data, allowing for timely corrections and improvements in data collection and analysis processes. This contributes to more informed decision-making and enhances the credibility of the NSDP monitoring and evaluation framework.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"National Sustainable Development Plan Data Reviewed Annually\" indicator, assess whether a formal review of NSDP-related data took place during the reporting year. This review should include analysis of progress against the targets and indicators outlined in the NSDP. The indicator is binary, with a \"Yes\" indicating that the review occurred and a \"No\" indicating that it did not.\n\n\nFormula:\nNSDP Data Reviewed Annually= Yes/No\n","SDGAlignment":"17.9.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Yes/No","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic Policy Planning & Aid Coordination ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"NSDP data reviewed annually","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC6-09-01"}
