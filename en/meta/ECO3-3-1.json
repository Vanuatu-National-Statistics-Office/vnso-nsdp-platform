The rate of return is typically expressed as a percentage, representing the net benefits derived from these investments relative to their costs.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in rural infrastructure by calculating the returns generated from such investments over time. Rural infrastructure projects are crucial for enhancing connectivity, improving access to essential services, boosting agricultural productivity, and fostering economic development in rural areas. The rate of return provides insight into the economic viability and impact of these projects, helping to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs and to what extent these investments contribute to the overall economic growth of rural communities.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the rate of return to investments in rural infrastructure is essential for evaluating the success and sustainability of rural development initiatives. A higher rate of return indicates that investments in infrastructure are generating significant economic benefits, such as increased income, reduced costs, improved productivity, and enhanced quality of life for rural populations. Conversely, a lower rate of return may suggest that the investments are not yielding the expected benefits, possibly due to inefficiencies, inadequate planning, or external factors.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Rate of Return to Investments in Rural Infrastructure,\" first collect data on the total costs of rural infrastructure projects and the economic benefits generated by these projects. Calculate the net benefits by subtracting the total costs from the total economic benefits. Then, calculate the rate of return by dividing the net benefits by the total investment costs and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. This percentage represents the financial or economic return on investments made in rural infrastructure.\n\nFormula:\nRate of Return (%) = ((Total Economic Benefits \u2013 Total Investment Costs)/Total Investment Costs)*100\n","SDGAlignment":"9.3.1\n9.3.2\n17.b.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Finance & Treasury","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Rate of Return to investments in rural infrastructure","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO3-03-01"}
