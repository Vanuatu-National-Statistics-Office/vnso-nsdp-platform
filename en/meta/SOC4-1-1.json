Gender-responsive approaches are those that recognize and address the different needs, opportunities, and challenges faced by all genders, with a focus on promoting equality and inclusion.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent to which government departments are integrating gender considerations into their policies, laws, and programs. Gender-responsive policies and programs aim to reduce gender disparities, promote equal opportunities, and ensure that the impacts of government actions are equitable across all genders. The indicator reflects the commitment of government institutions to mainstream gender equality across all areas of public administration.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of government departments with gender-responsive policies, legislation, and programs is essential for assessing the government's commitment to gender equality. It provides insight into how well gender considerations are being integrated into the broader policy and legislative framework. High proportions indicate that gender equality is being systematically addressed across government departments, which is crucial for creating an inclusive society.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Government Departments with Gender-Responsive Policies, Legislation, and Programs,\" first identify and list all relevant government departments. Then, assess each department to determine whether they have developed and implemented gender-responsive policies, legislation, and programs. Next, count the number of departments that meet this criterion and divide it by the total number of departments identified. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Government Departments with Gender Responsive Policies (%) = (Number of Departments with Gender Responsive Measures/Total Number of Departments Assessed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.a.1 & 5.c.1 ","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Women\u2019s Affairs","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of  government departments with gender responsive policies, legislation and programs","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-01-01"}
