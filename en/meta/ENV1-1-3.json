The indicator is typically expressed as a percentage and reflects the severity of food poverty within a population.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the extent of food poverty at the household level by assessing the average incidence across the population. The Food Poverty Line (FPL) is a threshold that represents the minimum income or expenditure required for an individual or household to afford a basic, nutritionally adequate diet. Households with incomes or expenditures below this threshold are considered to be living in food poverty. The indicator provides insights into the prevalence and distribution of food insecurity within a population, highlighting the vulnerability of certain households to hunger and malnutrition.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the average incidence of food poverty at the household level is crucial for understanding the depth and breadth of food insecurity within a community, region, or country. A high incidence of food poverty indicates that a significant proportion of households are unable to meet their basic nutritional needs, which can lead to adverse health outcomes, reduced productivity, and social instability.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Average Incidence of Food Poverty at the Household Level (Food Poverty Line),\" first collect data on household income or expenditure levels. Define the Food Poverty Line (FPL), which represents the minimum income or expenditure required for a basic, nutritionally adequate diet. Identify the households whose income or expenditure falls below this threshold. Calculate the average incidence of food poverty by dividing the number of households below the FPL by the total number of households surveyed, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nFormula:\nAverage Incidence of Food Poverty (%) = (Number of Households Below the FPL/Total Number of Households Surveyed) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.1 & 14.7.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percenatge of population (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Average incidence of food poverty at the household level (Food Poverty Line)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[{"organisation":"","periodicity":"","earliest_available":"","geographical_coverage":"","url":"","url_text":"","release_date":"","next_release":"","statistical_classification":"","contact":"","other_info":"","logo":""}],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"2019 Data","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-01-03"}
