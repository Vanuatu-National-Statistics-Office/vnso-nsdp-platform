These technologies may include mobile phones, radio, television, sirens, and internet-based systems.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the availability and reach of early warning technologies among the population. Access to such technologies is crucial for timely dissemination of critical information that can help individuals and communities take preventive actions, evacuate if necessary, and reduce the risk of harm. The indicator provides insights into the effectiveness and inclusiveness of early warning systems in reaching vulnerable and remote populations.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population with access to early warning technologies is essential for assessing the effectiveness of disaster preparedness and response systems. Timely access to early warnings can save lives, reduce injuries, and minimize property damage by allowing people to act quickly in response to impending hazards.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Population with Access to Technologies That Convey Early Warnings,\" first collect data on the number of people who have access to technologies capable of delivering early warnings, such as mobile phones, radios, televisions, and internet services. Then, determine the total population of the area being assessed. Calculate the proportion by dividing the number of people with access to early warning technologies by the total population, and multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Population with Access to Early Warning Technologies (%) = (Number of People with Access to Early Warning Technologies/Total Population) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.1.1, 13.2.1, 13.3.1, 13.3.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Every 5-10 years","source_organisation_1":"Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with access to technologies that conveys early warnings","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-02-02"}
