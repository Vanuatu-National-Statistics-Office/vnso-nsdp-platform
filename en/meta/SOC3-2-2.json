TB is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body.","Concept":"This indicator tracks the rate at which TB is occurring in the population, providing a measure of the burden of the disease and the effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at preventing and controlling TB. The incidence rate is a key metric for understanding the spread of TB within a community and assessing the impact of TB control programs.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Incidence of TB per 100,000 Population,\" first collect data on the number of new and relapse TB cases diagnosed within the specified period. Then, obtain the total population size for the same period. Next, divide the total number of TB cases by the total population, and multiply the result by 100,000 to express the incidence rate per 100,000 population.\n\nFormula:\nTB Incidence Rate (per 100,000 population) = (Number of New and Relapse TB Cases/Total Population) * 100,000\n","SDGAlignment":"3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, & 3.4.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Incidence per 100,000 population","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-15","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Incidence of TB (per 100,000 population)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-02-02"}
