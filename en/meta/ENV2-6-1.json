It also measures the proportion of total government expenditure allocated to environmental activities.","Concept":"This indicator tracks two key aspects of environmental funding: (1) the success rate of the DEPC in securing funding for sustainable development projects through the NPP, and (2) the share of government spending dedicated to environmental activities. It reflects the government's commitment to supporting environmental protection and sustainable development through adequate budget allocations.","Disaggregation":"Region","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of funding approved for DEPC initiatives and the percentage of government expenditure allocated to environmental activities is essential for assessing the prioritization of environmental sustainability in national budgeting and planning processes. Adequate funding is critical for the DEPC to implement effective policies, programs, and projects aimed at conserving natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable development.","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the \"Proportion of Funding Requested by DEPC Approved Through the National Planning Process\" and the \"Percentage of Government Expenditure for Environmental Activities,\" first collect data on the total amount of funding requested by the DEPC and the amount approved through the NPP. Then, gather data on the total government expenditure and the portion allocated to environmental activities. For the DEPC funding proportion, divide the approved amount by the requested amount, and for the government expenditure percentage, divide the expenditure on environmental activities by the total government expenditure. Finally, multiply both results by 100 to express them as percentages.\n\n\nFormula:\nProportion of Approved Funding (%) = (Amount of DEPC Funding Approved Through NPP/Total Amount of DEPC Funding Requested) * 100\n","SDGAlignment":"13.a.1 , 17.7.1","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"Department of Strategic Policy Planning & Aid Coordination  ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of funding requested by DEPC in support of sustainable development approved through NPP/percentage of government expenditure for environmental activities","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV2-06-01"}
