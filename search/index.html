While the Government cannot legally exceed the budget, it is also important to manage actual spending against planned spending from an efficiency perspective. It is easier to analyse the budget when it is broken down by program and activity, for example by just looking at expenditure on improving food security, on correctional services or on water resources, rather than an entire ministry or even the whole Government. It is also helpful to breakdown expenditure into types of spending, e.g. payroll, operations and capital expenditure.\n\nWhile it is relatively straightforward to plan spending on payroll, as organisational structures and staff salaries do not normally change much throughout the year, unexpected events do occur. Generally, the payroll budget is underspent, as ministries must budget for any staff vacancies that they wish to fill during the year, and they cannot immediately hire new staff on 1st January, leading to underspending against budget during the recruitment process. In terms of operations, it can take time to plan projects and undertake the procurement process, delaying the planned activities and leading to underspending in a given financial year. Alternatively, activities can cost more than planned, due to unforeseen circumstances.\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/grades/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/grades/","title":"GRADES\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/household-facilities/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/household-facilities/","title":"Vanuatu Household Profile.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/indicator-overview/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/indicator-overview/","title":"Status Overview- assessment for Vanuatu from previous years\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/install-app/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/install-app/","title":"App installation instructions\n","content":"{% include app-install-instructions.html %}\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/labour/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/labour/","title":"Vanuatu Labour.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/methodology/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/methodology/","title":"Indicators Status Summary\n","content":"As means of providing at-a-glance information on the status of the sustainability indicators, every indicator is assigned, if calculable, one of four “weather symbols” in the report. This symbol is neither a political appraisal nor a forecast. Instead, the symbols provide a first impression of developments but do not replace a study of the explanatory texts, further analyses and background information. The manner in which the symbols are assigned to the individual indicators depends on the formulation of the respective target.\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most of the cases an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete absolute or relative target value by a target year (for example indicator ECO 1.5.3). In the case of such a target formulation, first the average annual change over the last five years is calculated by means of the last six data points. This value is imputed for all years up to the target year. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is calculated and compared to the predefined target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between these two values, the indicators are assigned one of the following symbols:\n\n  If the development continued, the target value would be reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  If the development continued, the target would presumably be missed by at least 5%, but no more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  Although the indicator is developing in the desired direction towards the target, if the development continues, the target in the target year would be missed by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  The distance to the target is constantly high or increasing. The indicator is not developing in the desired direction.\n\nIn exceptional cases where there are not enough data for the above mentioned calculation to be carried out, the last four consecutive points of time for which data are available will, as a minimum, be used to calculate the average change. In the case of less than four suitable annual values, there will be no calculation.\n\nIndicators with directional targets without specific target values\n\nIn cases where only the targeted direction of the indicator trend is given but no concrete target value (for example indicator ENV 1.1.3), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the average change over the last five years and, subordinately, the last annual change.\n\n•\tIf both the average value and the last annual change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a sun.    \n•\tIf the average trend is moving in the right direction but the last year was characterised by a trend in the wrong direction or no change at all, the sun is partly hidden by a cloud.   \n•\tIf, on the contrary, the average value points in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation while the last year appears to mark a turn in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.   \n•\tIf neither the average value nor the last change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a thunderstorm.   \n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for one indicator that are to be reached at the same time (for example indicator 10.1), the development is evaluated individually for each target. The most negative evaluation determines the weather symbol to be assigned to the indicator.\n\nComparison of evaluations over time\n\nThe synoptic table provides information also about the evaluation of an indicator in previous years. It shows if the weather symbol assigned to an indicator was rather stable or volatile in the past years.\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/news/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/news/","title":"News &amp; Events\n","content":"Check this page for news regarding the reporting of our statistics for national indicators and opportunities to contribute to measuring achievement of the NSDP goals\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/primary-production/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/primary-production/","title":"Vanuatu Primary Production.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/publications/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/bi/publications/","title":"National Sustainable Development Plan Baseline Survey\n","content":"The NSDP Baseline Survey is an expanded Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and is inclusive of health educational, cultural, and productive dimensions previous uncollected or in need of updating.

Tracking the budgets and expenses of the nation in line with its implementation of the targets, which are aligned with national development priorities, will give the opportunity for all stakeholders to assess how much the various goals and metrics have been accomplished over the years, laying the groundwork for determining how much more will be needed to realise the NSDP. The transparent reporting on government’s spending to achieve the NSDP provides both Private Sector and Multilateral Development Partners the opportunity to determine which goals require more attention, or the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that require financial or technical assistance in working towards the achievement of the Goals. It also provides the Government the opportunity to adjust its allocations to ensure the equitable distribution of resources across MDAs. This reporting seeks to provide data that will enable the Government and its partners to monitor the progress being made on the various Goals against the investments made over the years to ascertain the efficient use of all financial resources.\n","id":"government.financial.statistics"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/government":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/government","title":"Government Finances\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/household-facilities/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/household-facilities/","title":"Vanuatu Household Profile.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/indicator-overview/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/indicator-overview/","title":"Status Overview- assessment for Vanuatu from previous years\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/install-app/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/install-app/","title":"App installation instructions\n","content":"{% include app-install-instructions.html %}\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/labour/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/labour/","title":"Vanuatu Labour.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/methodology/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/methodology/","title":"Indicators Status Summary\n","content":"As means of providing at-a-glance information on the status of the sustainability indicators, every indicator is assigned, if calculable, one of four “weather symbols” in the report. This symbol is neither a political appraisal nor a forecast. Instead, the symbols provide a first impression of developments but do not replace a study of the explanatory texts, further analyses and background information. The manner in which the symbols are assigned to the individual indicators depends on the formulation of the respective target.\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most of the cases an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete absolute or relative target value by a target year (for example indicator ECO 1.5.3). In the case of such a target formulation, first the average annual change over the last five years is calculated by means of the last six data points. This value is imputed for all years up to the target year. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is calculated and compared to the predefined target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between these two values, the indicators are assigned one of the following symbols:\n\n  If the development continued, the target value would be reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  If the development continued, the target would presumably be missed by at least 5%, but no more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  Although the indicator is developing in the desired direction towards the target, if the development continues, the target in the target year would be missed by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  The distance to the target is constantly high or increasing. The indicator is not developing in the desired direction.\n\nIn exceptional cases where there are not enough data for the above mentioned calculation to be carried out, the last four consecutive points of time for which data are available will, as a minimum, be used to calculate the average change. In the case of less than four suitable annual values, there will be no calculation.\n\nIndicators with directional targets without specific target values\n\nIn cases where only the targeted direction of the indicator trend is given but no concrete target value (for example indicator ENV 1.1.3), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the average change over the last five years and, subordinately, the last annual change.\n\n•\tIf both the average value and the last annual change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a sun.    \n•\tIf the average trend is moving in the right direction but the last year was characterised by a trend in the wrong direction or no change at all, the sun is partly hidden by a cloud.   \n•\tIf, on the contrary, the average value points in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation while the last year appears to mark a turn in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.   \n•\tIf neither the average value nor the last change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a thunderstorm.   \n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for one indicator that are to be reached at the same time (for example indicator 10.1), the development is evaluated individually for each target. The most negative evaluation determines the weather symbol to be assigned to the indicator.\n\nComparison of evaluations over time\n\nThe synoptic table provides information also about the evaluation of an indicator in previous years. It shows if the weather symbol assigned to an indicator was rather stable or volatile in the past years.\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/news/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/news/","title":"News &amp; Events\n","content":"Check this page for news regarding the reporting of our statistics for national indicators and opportunities to contribute to measuring achievement of the NSDP goals\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/primary-production/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/primary-production/","title":"Vanuatu Primary Production.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/publications/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/publications/","title":"National Sustainable Development Plan Baseline Survey\n","content":"The NSDP Baseline Survey is an expanded Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and is inclusive of health educational, cultural, and productive dimensions previous uncollected or in need of updating.

However, despite efforts to improve access to education, the enrollment rates remain a challenge in Vanuatu. The overall enrolment rate in primary is around 82%, with a slightly lower rate in secondary school at 68%. There are also significant disparities in enrolments rates between urban and rural areas, with urban area having higher enrolments rates. Additional, gender-based disparities persist, with boys having a slightly higher enrolments than girls. The reasons for low enrolment rates are complex and include financial barriers, poor infrastructure, and cultural attitudes that prioritize other activities over education. Addressing these challenges will require a multi-pronged approach that involves investing in education infrastructure, providing financial support to families, and working with communities to change attitudes towards education. Ultimately, improving enrolment rates in Vanuatu is essential for its economic, social and environment development.\n","id":"enrolments"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/labor/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/labor/","title":"Indicator labor - Vanuatu Labour Statistics","content":"A small nation like The Republic of Vanuatu located in the south pacific has its economy depending primarily on agriculture, tourism, and fishing. As a developing country labor statistics can play a crucial role in shaping the country’s development goals. Here are some of the  significant  labor statistics in Vanuatu and how they can help the country achieve its development goals.\n\n\n  Low employment rate\nVanuatu has a low employment rate of around 31%, and this can be seen as significant challenge  towards the country’s development. this low employment rate can result  in limited job opportunities, lack of skills, or low education levels. To address this challenge, Vanuatu needs to invest in creating a conducive environment for businesses to grow, promoting entrepreneurship, and equipping the workforce with the  necessary skills for current labor market needs.\n\n\n2.High youth unemployment\nVanuatu also has a high youth unemployment rate of around 26%. Youth make up a significant portion of the population, and addressing their unemployment challenges is critical to the country’s development. Encouraging entrepreneurship, vocational training, and promoting industries that can hire  and engage the youth can address this challenge.\n\n3.Informal sector dominance\nAround 80% of Vanuatu workforce is engaged in the informal sector, which often comes with low wages, limited job security, and poor working conditions. The government of Vanuatu can promote an enabling business environment, implement policies aimed at formalizing the informal sector, and offer incentives to the sector’s actors to reduce the dominance of the informal sector in the economy.\n\n4.Gender gap\nVanuatu labor market experiences gender  gaps with women underrepresented in high-earning jobs or formal employment. Promoting gender equality, enacting laws that promote women’s inclusion in the workforce, and creating awareness of gender disparities in the labor market can help bridge this gap.\n\nTherefore labor statistics play a crucial role in informing the country’s development goals. Addressing the employment, youth employment, informal sector dominance, and gender equality may help Vanuatu bridge the economic disparities that deny many citizens access to essentials services and uplift their standards of  living.\n","id":"labor"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC3-3-3/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC3-3-3/","title":"Indicator SOC3.3.3 - Under 5 mortality rate","content":"\n","id":"SOC3.3.3"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-4-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-4-1/","title":"Indicator SOC1.4.1 - Proportion of bills that are reviewed by MCC prior to parliamentary debate","content":"\n","id":"SOC1.4.1"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ECO3-5-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ECO3-5-1/","title":"Indicator ECO3.5.1 - Total annual number of rural economic analysis reports published","content":"\n","id":"ECO3.5.1"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC5-1-2/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC5-1-2/","title":"Indicator SOC5.1.2 - Annual change in number of Magistrate and Supreme Court pending cases","content":"\n","id":"SOC5.1.2"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ENV4-2-2/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ENV4-2-2/","title":"Indicator ENV4.2.2 - Establishment of GIS mapping relevant to the management of forest activities","content":"\n","id":"ENV4.2.2"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ENV4-6-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/ENV4-6-1/","title":"Indicator ENV4.6.1 - Annual estimated area (square km) of reforestation and rehabilitation","content":"\n","id":"ENV4.6.1"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-1-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-1-1/","title":"Indicator SOC1.1.1 - Proportion of population speaking indigenous language daily","content":"\n","id":"SOC1.1.1"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-1-3/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/SOC1-1-3/","title":"Indicator SOC1.1.3 - Proportion of endangered languages documented","content":"\n","id":"SOC1.1.3"},"/vnso-nsdp-platform/health/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/vnso-nsdp-platform/health/","title":"Indicator health - Vanuatu Health Statistics","content":"This standalone indicator basically provide information and data for health over the past decades.

A country’s gross domestic product or GDP is a measure of the size and health of its economy. It is the total value of goods and services produced over a specific time period. An annual GDP growth rate of 3%, then, simply means that the economy has grown by 3% over the past year.When GDP goes up, the economy is generally thought to be doing well. Meanwhile, weak growth signals that the economy is doing poorly. If GDP falls from one year to the next then growth is negative.
